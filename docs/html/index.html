<h2 id="what-gn-is-for">What GN is for</h2>
<p>GN is currently used as the build system for Chromium, Fuchsia, and related
projects. Some strengths of GN are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is designed for large projects and large teams. It scales efficiently to
many thousands of build files and tens of thousands of source files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It has a readable, clean syntax. Once a build is set-up, it is generally
easy for people with no backround in GN to make basic edits to the build.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is designed for multi-platform projects. It can cleanly express many
complicated build variants across different platforms. A single build
invocation can target multiple platforms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It supports multiple parallel output directories, each with their own
configuration. This allows a developer to maintain builds targeting debug,
release, or different platforms in parallel without forced rebuilds when
switching.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It has a focus on correctness. GN checks for the correct dependencies,
inputs, and outputs to the extent possible, and has a number of tools to
allow developers to ensure the build evolves as desired (for example, <code>gn
check</code>, <code>testonly</code>, <code>assert_no_deps</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It has comprehensive build-in help available from the command-line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although small projects successfully use GN, the focus on large projects has
some disadvanages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GN has the goal of being minimally expressive. Although it can be quite
flexible, a design goal is to direct members of a large team (who may not
have much knowledge about the build) down an easy-to-understand, well-lit
path. This isn&#39;t necessarily the correct trade-off for smaller projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The minimal build configuration is relatively heavyweight. There are several
files required and the exact way all compilers are linkers are run must be
specified in the configuration (see &quot;Examples&quot; below). There is no default
compiler configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is not easily composable. GN is designed to compile a single large
project with relatively uniform settings and rules. Projects like Chromium
do bring together multiple repositories from multiple teams, but the
projects must agree on some conventions in the build files to allow this to
work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>GN is designed with the expectation that the developers build a project want
to compile an identical configuration. So while builds can integrate
with the user&#39;s environment like the CXX and CFLAGS variables if they want,
this is not the default and most project&#39;s builds do not do this. The result
is that many GN projects do not integrate well with other systems like
ebuild.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no simple release scheme (see &quot;Versioning and distribution&quot; below).
Projects are expected to manage the version of GN they require. Getting an
appropriate GN binary can be a hurdle for new contributors to a project.
Since it is relatively uncommon, it can be more difficult to find
information and examples.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>GN can generate Ninja build files for C, C++, Rust, Objective C, and Swift
source on most popular platforms. Other languages can be compiled using the
general &quot;action&quot; rules (Google does this for Java and Go). But because this is
not as clean, generally GN is only used when the bulk of the build is in one of
the main built-in languages.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-binary">Getting a binary</h2>
<p>You can download the latest version of GN binary for
<a href="https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/dl/gn/gn/linux-amd64/+/latest">Linux</a>,
<a href="https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/dl/gn/gn/mac-amd64/+/latest">macOS</a> and
<a href="https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/dl/gn/gn/windows-amd64/+/latest">Windows</a>
from Google&#39;s build infrastructure (see &quot;Versioning and distribution&quot; below for
how this is expected to work).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can build GN from source with a C++17 compiler:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://gn.googlesource.com/gn
cd gn
python build/gen.py
ninja -C out
# To run tests:
out/gn_unittests
</code></pre><p>On Windows, it is expected that <code>cl.exe</code>, <code>link.exe</code>, and <code>lib.exe</code> can be found
in <code>PATH</code>, so you&#39;ll want to run from a Visual Studio command prompt, or
similar.</p>
<p>On Linux and Mac, the default compiler is <code>clang++</code>, a recent version is
expected to be found in <code>PATH</code>. This can be overridden by setting <code>CC</code>, <code>CXX</code>,
and <code>AR</code>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>There is a simple example in <a href="examples/simple_build">examples/simple_build</a>
directory that is a good place to get started with the minimal configuration.</p>
<p>To build and run the simple example with the default gcc compiler:</p>
<pre><code>cd examples/simple_build
../../out/gn gen -C out
ninja -C out
./out/hello
</code></pre><p>For a maximal configuration see the Chromium setup:</p>

<h2 id="reporting-bugs">Reporting bugs</h2>
<p>If you find a bug, you can see if it is known or report it in the <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gn/issues/list">bug
database</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sending-patches">Sending patches</h2>
<p>GN uses <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a> for code review. The short
version of how to patch is:</p>
<pre><code>Register at https://gn-review.googlesource.com.

... edit code ...
ninja -C out &amp;&amp; out/gn_unittests
</code></pre><p>Then, to upload a change for review:</p>
<pre><code>git commit
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
</code></pre><p>The first time you do this you&#39;ll get an error from the server about a missing
change-ID. Follow the directions in the error message to install the change-ID
hook and run <code>git commit --amend</code> to apply the hook to the current commit.</p>
<p>When revising a change, use:</p>
<pre><code>git commit --amend
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
</code></pre><p>which will add the new changes to the existing code review, rather than creating
a new one.</p>
<p>We ask that all contributors
<a href="https://cla.developers.google.com/">sign Google&#39;s Contributor License Agreement</a>
(either individual or corporate as appropriate, select &#39;any other Google
project&#39;).</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>You may ask questions and follow along with GN&#39;s development on Chromium&#39;s
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/gn-dev">gn-dev@</a>
Google Group.</p>
<h2 id="versioning-and-distribution">Versioning and distribution</h2>
<p>Most projects are designed to use the developer&#39;s computer&#39;s current toolchain
such as compiler, linker, and build tool. But the large projects that GN is
designed for typically want a more hermetic environment. They will ensure that
developers are using a specific compatible toolchain that is versioned with the
code</p>
<p>As a result, GN expects that the project choose the appropriate version of GN
that will work with each version of the project. There is no &quot;current stable
version&quot; of GN that is expected to work for all projects.</p>
<p>As a result, the GN developers to not maintain any packages in any of the
various packaging systems (Debian, RedHat, HomeBrew, etc.). Some of these
systems to have GN packages, but they are maintained by third parties and you
should use at your own risk. Instead, we recommend you refer your checkout
tooling to download binaries for a specific hash from <a href="https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/gn/gn">Google&#39;s build
infrastructure</a> or compile
your own.</p>
<p>GN does not guarantee the backwards-compatibility of new versions and has no
branches or versioning scheme beyond the sequence of commits to the master git
branch (which is expected to be stable).</p>
<p>In practice, however, GN is very backwards-compatible. The core functionality
has been stable for many years and there is enough GN code at Google alone to
make non-backwards-compatible changes very difficult, even if they were
desirable.</p>
<p>There have been discussions about adding a versioning scheme with some
guarantees about backwards-compatibility, but nothing has yet been implemented.</p>
