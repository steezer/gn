<h3 id="-a-name-cmd_analyze-a-gn-analyze-out_dir-input_path-output_path"><a name="cmd_analyze"></a><strong>gn analyze &lt;out_dir&gt; &lt;input_path&gt; &lt;output_path&gt;</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  Analyze which targets are affected by a list of files.

  This command takes three arguments:

  out_dir is the path to the build directory.

  input_path is a path to a file containing a JSON object with three fields:

   - &quot;files&quot;: A list of the filenames to check.

   - &quot;test_targets&quot;: A list of the labels for targets that are needed to run
     the tests we wish to run.

   - &quot;additional_compile_targets&quot;: A list of the labels for targets that we
     wish to rebuild, but aren&#39;t necessarily needed for testing. The important
     difference between this field and &quot;test_targets&quot; is that if an item in
     the additional_compile_targets list refers to a group, then any
     dependencies of that group will be returned if they are out of date, but
     the group itself does not need to be. If the dependencies themselves are
     groups, the same filtering is repeated. This filtering can be used to
     avoid rebuilding dependencies of a group that are unaffected by the input
     files. The list may also contain the string &quot;all&quot; to refer to a
     pseudo-group that contains every root target in the build graph.

     This filtering behavior is also known as &quot;pruning&quot; the list of compile
     targets.

  If input_path is -, input is read from stdin.

  output_path is a path indicating where the results of the command are to be
  written. The results will be a file containing a JSON object with one or more
  of following fields:

   - &quot;compile_targets&quot;: A list of the labels derived from the input
     compile_targets list that are affected by the input files. Due to the way
     the filtering works for compile targets as described above, this list may
     contain targets that do not appear in the input list.

   - &quot;test_targets&quot;: A list of the labels from the input test_targets list that
     are affected by the input files. This list will be a proper subset of the
     input list.

   - &quot;invalid_targets&quot;: A list of any names from the input that do not exist in
     the build graph. If this list is non-empty, the &quot;error&quot; field will also be
     set to &quot;Invalid targets&quot;.

   - &quot;status&quot;: A string containing one of three values:

       - &quot;Found dependency&quot;
       - &quot;No dependency&quot;
       - &quot;Found dependency (all)&quot;

     In the first case, the lists returned in compile_targets and test_targets
     should be passed to ninja to build. In the second case, nothing was
     affected and no build is necessary. In the third case, GN could not
     determine the correct answer and returned the input as the output in order
     to be safe.

   - &quot;error&quot;: This will only be present if an error occurred, and will contain
     a string describing the error. This includes cases where the input file is
     not in the right format, or contains invalid targets.

  If output_path is -, output is written to stdout.

  The command returns 1 if it is unable to read the input file or write the
  output file, or if there is something wrong with the build such that gen
  would also fail, and 0 otherwise. In particular, it returns 0 even if the
  &quot;error&quot; key is non-empty and a non-fatal error occurred. In other words, it
  tries really hard to always write something to the output JSON and convey
  errors that way rather than via return codes.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-cmd_args-a-gn-args-command-line-tool-"><a name="cmd_args"></a><strong>gn args</strong>: (command-line tool)</h3>
<pre><code>  Display or configure arguments declared by the build.

    gn args &lt;out_dir&gt; [--list] [--short] [--args] [--overrides-only]

  See also &quot;gn help buildargs&quot; for a more high-level overview of how
  build arguments work.
</code></pre><h4 id="usage"><strong>Usage</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  gn args &lt;out_dir&gt;
      Open the arguments for the given build directory in an editor. If the
      given build directory doesn&#39;t exist, it will be created and an empty args
      file will be opened in the editor. You would type something like this
      into that file:
          enable_doom_melon=false
          os=&quot;android&quot;

      To find your editor on Posix, GN will search the environment variables in
      order: GN_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR. On Windows GN will open the command
      associated with .txt files.

      Note: you can edit the build args manually by editing the file &quot;args.gn&quot;
      in the build directory and then running &quot;gn gen &lt;out_dir&gt;&quot;.

  gn args &lt;out_dir&gt; --list[=&lt;exact_arg&gt;] [--short] [--overrides-only] [--json]
      Lists all build arguments available in the current configuration, or, if
      an exact_arg is specified for the list flag, just that one build
      argument.

      The output will list the declaration location, current value for the
      build, default value (if different than the current value), and comment
      preceding the declaration.

      If --short is specified, only the names and current values will be
      printed.

      If --overrides-only is specified, only the names and current values of
      arguments that have been overridden (i.e. non-default arguments) will
      be printed. Overrides come from the &lt;out_dir&gt;/args.gn file and //.gn

      If --json is specified, the output will be emitted in json format.
      JSON schema for output:
      [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: variable_name,

<pre><code>  GN&#39;s include header checker validates that the includes for C-like source
  files match the build dependency graph.

  &quot;gn check&quot; is the same thing as &quot;gn gen&quot; with the &quot;--check&quot; flag except that
  this command does not write out any build files. It&#39;s intended to be an easy
  way to manually trigger include file checking.

  The &lt;label_pattern&gt; can take exact labels or patterns that match more than
  one (although not general regular expressions). If specified, only those
  matching targets will be checked. See &quot;gn help label_pattern&quot; for details.
</code></pre><h4 id="command-specific-switches"><strong>Command-specific switches</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  --check-generated
      Generated files are normally not checked since they do not exist
      until after a build. With this flag, those generated files that
      can be found on disk are also checked.

  --check-system
     Check system style includes (using &lt;angle brackets&gt;) in addition to
     &quot;double quote&quot; includes.

  --default-toolchain
      Normally wildcard targets are matched in all toolchains. This
      switch makes wildcard labels with no explicit toolchain reference
      only match targets in the default toolchain.

      Non-wildcard inputs with no explicit toolchain specification will
      always match only a target in the default toolchain if one exists.

  --force
      Ignores specifications of &quot;check_includes = false&quot; and checks all
      target&#39;s files that match the target label.
</code></pre><h4 id="what-gets-checked"><strong>What gets checked</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The .gn file may specify a list of targets to be checked in the list
  check_targets (see &quot;gn help dotfile&quot;). Alternatively, the .gn file may
  specify a list of targets not to be checked in no_check_targets. If a label
  pattern is specified on the command line, neither check_targets or
  no_check_targets is used.

  Targets can opt-out from checking with &quot;check_includes = false&quot; (see
  &quot;gn help check_includes&quot;).

  For targets being checked:

    - GN opens all C-like source files in the targets to be checked and scans
      the top for includes.

    - Generated files (that might not exist yet) are ignored unless
      the --check-generated flag is provided.

    - Includes with a &quot;nogncheck&quot; annotation are skipped (see
      &quot;gn help nogncheck&quot;).

    - Includes using &quot;quotes&quot; are always checked.
        If system style checking is enabled, includes using &lt;angle brackets&gt;
        are also checked.

    - Include paths are assumed to be relative to any of the &quot;include_dirs&quot; for
      the target (including the implicit current dir).

    - GN does not run the preprocessor so will not understand conditional
      includes.

    - Only includes matching known files in the build are checked: includes
      matching unknown paths are ignored.

  For an include to be valid:

    - The included file must be in the current target, or there must be a path
      following only public dependencies to a target with the file in it
      (&quot;gn path&quot; is a good way to diagnose problems).

    - There can be multiple targets with an included file: only one needs to be
      valid for the include to be allowed.

    - If there are only &quot;sources&quot; in a target, all are considered to be public
      and can be included by other targets with a valid public dependency path.

    - If a target lists files as &quot;public&quot;, only those files are able to be
      included by other targets. Anything in the sources will be considered
      private and will not be includable regardless of dependency paths.

    - Outputs from actions are treated like public sources on that target.

    - A target can include headers from a target that depends on it if the
      other target is annotated accordingly. See &quot;gn help
      allow_circular_includes_from&quot;.
</code></pre><h4 id="advice-on-fixing-problems"><strong>Advice on fixing problems</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  If you have a third party project that is difficult to fix or doesn&#39;t care
  about include checks it&#39;s generally best to exclude that target from checking
  altogether via &quot;check_includes = false&quot;.

  If you have conditional includes, make sure the build conditions and the
  preprocessor conditions match, and annotate the line with &quot;nogncheck&quot; (see
  &quot;gn help nogncheck&quot; for an example).

  If two targets are hopelessly intertwined, use the
  &quot;allow_circular_includes_from&quot; annotation. Ideally each should have identical
  dependencies so configs inherited from those dependencies are consistent (see
  &quot;gn help allow_circular_includes_from&quot;).

  If you have a standalone header file or files that need to be shared between
  a few targets, you can consider making a source_set listing only those
  headers as public sources. With only header files, the source set will be a
  no-op from a build perspective, but will give a central place to refer to
  those headers. That source set&#39;s files will still need to pass &quot;gn check&quot; in
  isolation.

  In rare cases it makes sense to list a header in more than one target if it
  could be considered conceptually a member of both.

    A list of target labels from which to initiate the walk.

  --data
    A list of keys from which to extract data. In each target walked, its metadata
    scope is checked for the presence of these keys. If present, the contents of
    those variable in the scope are appended to the results list.

  --walk (optional)
    A list of keys from which to control the walk. In each target walked, its
    metadata scope is checked for the presence of any of these keys. If present,
    the contents of those variables is checked to ensure that it is a label of
    a valid dependency of the target and then added to the set of targets to walk.
    If the empty string (&quot;&quot;) is present in any of these keys, all deps and data_deps
    are added to the walk set.

  --rebase (optional)
    A destination directory onto which to rebase any paths found. If set, all
    collected metadata will be rebased onto this path. This option will throw errors
    if collected metadata is not a list of strings.

<pre><code>  Lists the output files corresponding to the given target(s) or file name(s).
  There can be multiple outputs because there can be more than one output
  generated by a build step, and there can be more than one toolchain matched.
  You can also list multiple inputs which will generate a union of all the
  outputs from those inputs.

   - The input target/file names are relative to the current directory.

   - The output file names are relative to the root build directory.

   This command is useful for finding a ninja command that will build only a
   portion of the build.
</code></pre><h4 id="target-outputs"><strong>Target outputs</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  If the parameter is a target name that includes a toolchain, it will match
  only that target in that toolchain. If no toolchain is specified, it will
  match all targets with that name in any toolchain.

  The result will be the outputs specified by that target which could be a
  library, executable, output of an action, a stamp file, etc.
</code></pre><h4 id="file-outputs"><strong>File outputs</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  If the parameter is a file name it will compute the output for that compile
  step for all targets in all toolchains that contain that file as a source
  file.

  If the source is not compiled (e.g. a header or text file), the command will
  produce no output.

  If the source is listed as an &quot;input&quot; to a binary target or action will
  resolve to that target&#39;s outputs.

<pre><code>  Finds paths of dependencies between two targets. Each unique path will be
  printed in one group, and groups will be separate by newlines. The two
  targets can appear in either order (paths will be found going in either
  direction).

  By default, a single path will be printed. If there is a path with only
  public dependencies, the shortest public path will be printed. Otherwise, the
  shortest path using either public or private dependencies will be printed. If
  --with-data is specified, data deps will also be considered. If there are
  multiple shortest paths, an arbitrary one will be selected.
</code></pre><h4 id="interesting-paths"><strong>Interesting paths</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  In a large project, there can be 100&#39;s of millions of unique paths between a

  --public
     Considers only public paths. Can&#39;t be used with --with-data.

  --with-data
     Additionally follows data deps. Without this flag, only public and private
     linked deps will be followed. Can&#39;t be used with --public.

          [--default-toolchain] [--as=...] [--testonly=...] [--type=...]

  Finds reverse dependencies (which targets reference something). The input is
  a list containing:

   - Target label: The result will be which targets depend on it.

   - Config label: The result will be which targets list the given config in
     its &quot;configs&quot; or &quot;public_configs&quot; list.

   - Label pattern: The result will be which targets depend on any target
     matching the given pattern. Patterns will not match configs. These are not
     general regular expressions, see &quot;gn help label_pattern&quot; for details.

   - File name: The result will be which targets list the given file in its
     &quot;inputs&quot;, &quot;sources&quot;, &quot;public&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, or &quot;outputs&quot;. Any input that does
     not contain wildcards and does not match a target or a config will be
     treated as a file.

   - Response file: If the input starts with an &quot;@&quot;, it will be interpreted as
     a path to a file containing a list of labels or file names, one per line.
     This allows us to handle long lists of inputs without worrying about
     command line limits.
</code></pre><h4 id="options"><strong>Options</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  --all
      When used without --tree, will recurse and display all unique
      dependencies of the given targets. For example, if the input is a target,
      this will output all targets that depend directly or indirectly on the
      input. If the input is a file, this will output all targets that depend
      directly or indirectly on that file.

      When used with --tree, turns off eliding to show a complete tree.

  --as=(buildfile|label|output)
      How to print targets.

      buildfile
          Prints the build files where the given target was declared as
          file names.
      label  (default)
          Prints the label of the target.
      output
          Prints the first output file for the target relative to the
          root build directory.

  --default-toolchain
      Normally wildcard targets are matched in all toolchains. This
      switch makes wildcard labels with no explicit toolchain reference
      only match targets in the default toolchain.

      Non-wildcard inputs with no explicit toolchain specification will
      always match only a target in the default toolchain if one exists.

  -q
     Quiet. If nothing matches, don&#39;t print any output. Without this option, if
     there are no matches there will be an informational message printed which
     might interfere with scripts processing the output.

  --testonly=(true|false)
      Restrict outputs to targets with the testonly flag set
      accordingly. When unspecified, the target&#39;s testonly flags are
      ignored.

  --tree
      Outputs a reverse dependency tree from the given target. Duplicates will
      be elided. Combine with --all to see a full dependency tree.

      Tree output can not be used with the filtering or output flags: --as,
      --type, --testonly.

  --type=(action|copy|executable|group|loadable_module|shared_library|
          source_set|static_library)
      Restrict outputs to targets matching the given type. If
      unspecified, no filtering will be performed.

<pre><code>  This target type allows you to run a script a single time to produce one or
  more output files. If you want to run a script once for each of a set of
  input files, see &quot;gn help action_foreach&quot;.
</code></pre><h4 id="inputs"><strong>Inputs</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  In an action the &quot;sources&quot; and &quot;inputs&quot; are treated the same: they&#39;re both
  input dependencies on script execution with no special handling. If you want
  to pass the sources to your script, you must do so explicitly by including
  them in the &quot;args&quot;. Note also that this means there is no special handling of
  paths since GN doesn&#39;t know which of the args are paths and not. You will
  want to use rebase_path() to convert paths to be relative to the
  root_build_dir.

  You can dynamically write input dependencies (for incremental rebuilds if an
  input file changes) by writing a depfile when the script is run (see &quot;gn help
  depfile&quot;). This is more flexible than &quot;inputs&quot;.

  If the command line length is very long, you can use response files to pass
  args to your script. See &quot;gn help response_file_contents&quot;.

  It is recommended you put inputs to your script in the &quot;sources&quot; variable,
  and stuff like other Python files required to run your script in the &quot;inputs&quot;
  variable.

  The &quot;deps&quot; and &quot;public_deps&quot; for an action will always be
  completed before any part of the action is run so it can depend on
  the output of previous steps. The &quot;data_deps&quot; will be built if the
  action is built, but may not have completed before all steps of the
  action are started. This can give additional parallelism in the build
  for runtime-only dependencies.
</code></pre><h4 id="outputs"><strong>Outputs</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  You should specify files created by your script by specifying them in the
  &quot;outputs&quot;.

  The script will be executed with the given arguments with the current

  to your script, see &quot;gn help rebase_path&quot; for how to convert
  file names to be relative to the build directory (file names in the
  sources, outputs, and inputs will be all treated as relative to the
  current build file and converted as needed automatically).

  GN sets Ninja&#39;s flag &#39;restat = 1` for all action commands. This means
  that Ninja will check the timestamp of the output after the action
  completes. If output timestamp is unchanged, the step will be treated
  as if it never needed to be rebuilt, potentially eliminating some
  downstream steps for incremental builds. Scripts can improve build
  performance by taking care not to change the timstamp of the output
  file(s) if the contents have not changed.

</code></pre><h4 id="c-language-source_sets"><strong>C-language source_sets</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  A source set is a collection of sources that get compiled, but are not linked
  to produce any kind of library. Instead, the resulting object files are
  implicitly added to the linker line of all targets that depend on the source
  set.

  In most cases, a source set will behave like a static library, except no
  actual library file will be produced. This will make the build go a little
  faster by skipping creation of a large static library, while maintaining the
  organizational benefits of focused build targets.

  The main difference between a source set and a static library is around
  handling of exported symbols. Most linkers assume declaring a function
  exported means exported from the static library. The linker can then do dead
  code elimination to delete code not reachable from exported functions.

  A source set will not do this code elimination since there is no link step.
  This allows you to link many source sets into a shared library and have the
  &quot;exported symbol&quot; notation indicate &quot;export from the final shared library and
  not from the intermediate targets.&quot; There is no way to express this concept
  when linking multiple static libraries into a shared library.

  need to remove the corresponding config that sets it. The final set of flags,
  defines, etc. for a target is generated in this order:

   1. The values specified directly on the target (rather than using a config.
   2. The configs specified in the target&#39;s &quot;configs&quot; list, in order.
   3. Public_configs from a breadth-first traversal of the dependency tree in
      the order that the targets appear in &quot;deps&quot;.
   4. All dependent configs from a breadth-first traversal of the dependency
      tree in the order that the targets appear in &quot;deps&quot;.
</code></pre><h4 id="more-background"><strong>More background</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Configs solve a problem where the build system needs to have a higher-level
  understanding of various compiler settings. For example, some compiler flags
  have to appear in a certain order relative to each other, some settings like
  defines and flags logically go together, and the build system needs to
  de-duplicate flags even though raw command-line parameters can&#39;t always be
  operated on in that way.

  The config gives a name to a group of settings that can then be reasoned
  about by GN. GN can know that configs with the same label are the same thing
  so can be de-duplicated. It allows related settings to be grouped so they
  are added or removed as a unit. And it allows targets to refer to settings
  with conceptual names (&quot;no_rtti&quot;, &quot;enable_exceptions&quot;, etc.) rather than
  having to hard-coding every compiler&#39;s flags each time they are referred to.

<pre><code>  Introduces the given arguments into the current scope. If they are not
  specified on the command line or in a toolchain&#39;s arguments, the default
  values given in the declare_args block will be used. However, these defaults
  will not override command-line values.

  See also &quot;gn help buildargs&quot; for an overview.

  The precise behavior of declare args is:

   1. The declare_args() block executes. Any variable defined in the enclosing
      scope is available for reading, but any variable defined earlier in
      the current scope is not (since the overrides haven&#39;t been applied yet).

   2. At the end of executing the block, any variables set within that scope
      are saved, with the values specified in the block used as the &quot;default value&quot;
      for that argument. Once saved, these variables are available for override
      via args.gn.

   3. User-defined overrides are applied. Anything set in &quot;gn args&quot; now
      overrides any default values. The resulting set of variables is promoted
      to be readable from the following code in the file.

  This has some ramifications that may not be obvious:

    - You should not perform difficult work inside a declare_args block since
      this only sets a default value that may be discarded. In particular,
      don&#39;t use the result of exec_script() to set the default value. If you
      want to have a script-defined default, set some default &quot;undefined&quot; value
      like [], &quot;&quot;, or -1, and after the declare_args block, call exec_script if
      the value is unset by the user.

    - Because you cannot read the value of a variable defined in the same
      block, if you need to make the default value of one arg depend
      on the possibly-overridden value of another, write two separate
      declare_args() blocks:

        declare_args() {
          enable_foo = true
        }
        declare_args() {
          # Bar defaults to same user-overridden state as foo.
          enable_bar = enable_foo
        }
</code></pre><h4 id="example"><strong>Example</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  declare_args() {
    enable_teleporter = true
    enable_doom_melon = false
  }

  If you want to override the (default disabled) Doom Melon:
    gn --args=&quot;enable_doom_melon=true enable_teleporter=true&quot;
  This also sets the teleporter, but it&#39;s already defaulted to on so it will
  have no effect.

  Runs the given script, returning the stdout of the script. The build
  generation will fail if the script does not exist or returns a nonzero exit
  code.

  The current directory when executing the script will be the root build
  directory. If you are passing file names, you will want to use the

  The default script interpreter is Python (&quot;python&quot; on POSIX, &quot;python.exe&quot; or

  input_conversion:

      If unspecified, defaults to the empty string which causes the script

  dependencies:
      (Optional) A list of files that this script reads or otherwise depends

  Copies the given variables from the given scope to the local scope if they
  exist. This is normally used in the context of templates to use the values of
  variables defined in the template invocation to a template-defined target.

  The variables in the given variable_list will be copied if they exist in the
  given scope or any enclosing scope. If they do not exist, nothing will happen
  and they be left undefined in the current scope.

  As a special case, if the variable_list is a string with the value of &quot;*&quot;,
  all variables from the given scope will be copied. &quot;*&quot; only copies variables
  set directly on the from_scope, not enclosing ones. Otherwise it would
  duplicate all global variables.

  When an explicit list of variables is supplied, if the variable exists in the
  current (destination) scope already, an error will be thrown. If &quot;*&quot; is
  specified, variables in the current scope will be clobbered (the latter is
  important because most targets have an implicit configs list, which means it
  wouldn&#39;t work at all if it didn&#39;t clobber).

  If variables_to_not_forward_list is non-empty, then it must contains a list

  was called. If there is a conflict (both the current scope and the imported
  file define some variable or rule with the same name but different value), a
  runtime error will be thrown. Therefore, it&#39;s good practice to minimize the
  stuff that an imported file defines.

  Variables and templates beginning with an underscore &#39;_&#39; are considered
  private and will not be imported. Imported files can use such variables for
  internal computation without affecting other files.

  As the file containing the pool definition may be executed in the
  context of more than one toolchain it is recommended to specify an
  explicit toolchain when defining and referencing a pool.

  A pool named &quot;console&quot; defined in the root build file represents Ninja&#39;s
  console pool. Targets using this pool will have access to the console&#39;s
  stdin and stdout, and output will not be buffered. This special pool must
  have a depth of 1. Pools not defined in the root must not be named &quot;console&quot;.
  The console pool can only be defined for the default toolchain.
  Refer to the Ninja documentation on the console pool for more info.

  Takes a string argument representing a file name, or a list of such strings
  and converts it/them to be relative to a different base directory.

  When invoking the compiler or scripts, GN will automatically convert sources
  and include directories to be relative to the build directory. However, if
  you&#39;re passing files directly in the &quot;args&quot; array or doing other manual
  manipulations where GN doesn&#39;t know something is a file name, you will need
  to convert paths to be relative to what your tool is expecting.

  The common case is to use this to convert paths relative to the current
  directory to be relative to the build directory (which will be the current
  directory when executing scripts).

  If you want to convert a file path to be source-absolute (that is, beginning
  with a double slash like &quot;//foo/bar&quot;), you should use the get_path_info()
  function. This function won&#39;t work because it will always make relative
  paths, and it needs to support making paths relative to the source root, so
  it can&#39;t also generate source-absolute paths without more special-cases.
</code></pre><h4 id="arguments"><strong>Arguments</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  input
      A string or list of strings representing file or directory names. These
      can be relative paths (&quot;foo/bar.txt&quot;), system absolute paths
      (&quot;/foo/bar.txt&quot;), or source absolute paths (&quot;//foo/bar.txt&quot;).

  new_base
      The directory to convert the paths to be relative to. This can be an
      absolute path or a relative path (which will be treated as being relative
      to the current BUILD-file&#39;s directory).

      As a special case, if new_base is the empty string (the default), all
      paths will be converted to system-absolute native style paths with system
      path separators. This is useful for invoking external programs.

  current_base
      Directory representing the base for relative paths in the input. If this
      is not an absolute path, it will be treated as being relative to the
      current build file. Use &quot;.&quot; (the default) to convert paths from the
      current BUILD-file&#39;s directory.
</code></pre><h4 id="return-value"><strong>Return value</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The return value will be the same type as the input value (either a string or
  a list of strings). All relative and source-absolute file names will be
  converted to be relative to the requested output System-absolute paths will
  be unchanged.

  Whether an output path will end in a slash will match whether the
  corresponding input path ends in a slash. It will return &quot;.&quot; or &quot;./&quot;
  (depending on whether the input ends in a slash) to avoid returning empty
  strings. This means if you want a root path (&quot;//&quot; or &quot;/&quot;) not ending in a
  slash, you can add a dot (&quot;//.&quot;).

<pre><code>  A template defines a custom name that acts like a function. It provides a way
  to add to the built-in target types.

  The template() function is used to declare a template. To invoke the
  template, just use the name of the template like any other target type.

  Often you will want to declare your template in a special file that other
  files will import (see &quot;gn help import&quot;) so your template rule can be shared
  across build files.
</code></pre><h4 id="variables-and-templates-"><strong>Variables and templates</strong>:</h4>
<pre><code>  When you call template() it creates a closure around all variables currently
  in scope with the code in the template block. When the template is invoked,
  the closure will be executed.

  When the template is invoked, the code in the caller is executed and passed
  to the template code as an implicit &quot;invoker&quot; variable. The template uses
  this to read state out of the invoking code.

  One thing explicitly excluded from the closure is the &quot;current directory&quot;
  against which relative file names are resolved. The current directory will be
  that of the invoking code, since typically that code specifies the file
  names. This means all files internal to the template should use absolute
  names.

  A template will typically forward some or all variables from the invoking
  scope to a target that it defines. Often, such variables might be optional.
  Use the pattern:

    if (defined(invoker.deps)) {
      deps = invoker.deps
    }

  The function forward_variables_from() provides a shortcut to forward one or
  more or possibly all variables in this manner:

    forward_variables_from(invoker, [&quot;deps&quot;, &quot;public_deps&quot;])
</code></pre><h4 id="target-naming"><strong>Target naming</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Your template should almost always define a built-in target with the name the
  template invoker specified. For example, if you have an IDL template and
  somebody does:
    idl(&quot;foo&quot;) {...
  you will normally want this to expand to something defining a source_set or
  static_library named &quot;foo&quot; (among other things you may need). This way, when
  another target specifies a dependency on &quot;foo&quot;, the static_library or
  source_set will be linked.

  It is also important that any other targets your template expands to have
  unique names, or you will get collisions.

  Access the invoking name in your template via the implicit &quot;target_name&quot;
  variable. This should also be the basis for how other targets that a template
  expands to ensure uniqueness.

  A typical example would be a template that defines an action to generate some
  source files, and a source_set to compile that source. Your template would
  name the source_set &quot;target_name&quot; because that&#39;s what you want external
  targets to depend on to link your code. And you would name the action
  something like &quot;${target_name}_action&quot; to make it unique. The source set
  would have a dependency on the action to make it run.
</code></pre><h4 id="overriding-builtin-targets"><strong>Overriding builtin targets</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  You can use template to redefine a built-in target in which case your template
  takes a precedence over the built-in one. All uses of the target from within
  the template definition will refer to the built-in target which makes it
  possible to extend the behavior of the built-in target:

    template(&quot;shared_library&quot;) {
      shared_library(shlib) {
        forward_variables_from(invoker, &quot;*&quot;)

</code></pre><h4 id="tool-variables"><strong>Tool variables</strong></h4>
<pre><code>    command  [string with substitutions]
        Valid for: all tools except &quot;action&quot; (required)

        The command to run.

    command_launcher  [string]
        Valid for: all tools except &quot;action&quot; (optional)

        The prefix with which to launch the command (e.g. the path to a Goma or
        CCache compiler launcher).

        Note that this prefix will not be included in the compilation database or
        IDE files generated from the build.

    default_output_dir  [string with substitutions]
        Valid for: linker tools

        Default directory name for the output file relative to the
        root_build_dir. It can contain other substitution patterns. This will
        be the default value for the {{output_dir}} expansion (discussed below)
        but will be overridden by the &quot;output_dir&quot; variable in a target, if one
        is specified.

        GN doesn&#39;t do anything with this string other than pass it along,
        potentially with target-specific overrides. It is the tool&#39;s job to use
        the expansion so that the files will be in the right place.

    default_output_extension  [string]
        Valid for: linker tools

        Extension for the main output of a linkable tool. It includes the
        leading dot. This will be the default value for the
        {{output_extension}} expansion (discussed below) but will be overridden
        by by the &quot;output extension&quot; variable in a target, if one is specified.
        Empty string means no extension.

        GN doesn&#39;t actually do anything with this extension other than pass it
        along, potentially with target-specific overrides. One would typically
        use the {{output_extension}} value in the &quot;outputs&quot; to read this value.

        Example: default_output_extension = &quot;.exe&quot;

    depfile  [string with substitutions]
        Valid for: compiler tools (optional)

        If the tool can write &quot;.d&quot; files, this specifies the name of the
        resulting file. These files are used to list header file dependencies
        (or other implicit input dependencies) that are discovered at build
        time. See also &quot;depsformat&quot;.

        Example: depfile = &quot;{{output}}.d&quot;

    depsformat  [string]
        Valid for: compiler tools (when depfile is specified)

        Format for the deps outputs. This is either &quot;gcc&quot; or &quot;msvc&quot;. See the
        ninja documentation for &quot;deps&quot; for more information.

        Example: depsformat = &quot;gcc&quot;

    description  [string with substitutions, optional]
        Valid for: all tools

        What to print when the command is run.

        Example: description = &quot;Compiling {{source}}&quot;

    exe_output_extension [string, optional, rust tools only]
    rlib_output_extension [string, optional, rust tools only]
    dylib_output_extension [string, optional, rust tools only]
    cdylib_output_extension [string, optional, rust tools only]
    rust_proc_macro_output_extension [string, optional, rust tools only]
        Valid for: Rust tools

        These specify the default tool output for each of the crate types.
        The default is empty for executables, shared, and static libraries and
        &quot;.rlib&quot; for rlibs. Note that the Rust compiler complains with an error
        if external crates do not take the form `lib&lt;name&gt;.rlib` or
        `lib&lt;name&gt;.&lt;shared_extension&gt;`, where `&lt;shared_extension&gt;` is `.so`,
        `.dylib`, or `.dll` as appropriate for the platform.

    lib_switch  [string, optional, link tools only]
    lib_dir_switch  [string, optional, link tools only]
        Valid for: Linker tools except &quot;alink&quot;

        These strings will be prepended to the libraries and library search
        directories, respectively, because linkers differ on how to specify
        them.

        If you specified:
          lib_switch = &quot;-l&quot;
          lib_dir_switch = &quot;-L&quot;
        then the &quot;{{libs}}&quot; expansion for
          [ &quot;freetype&quot;, &quot;expat&quot; ]
        would be
          &quot;-lfreetype -lexpat&quot;.

    framework_switch [string, optional, link tools only]
    weak_framework_switch [string, optional, link tools only]
    framework_dir_switch [string, optional, link tools only]
        Valid for: Linker tools

        These strings will be prepended to the frameworks and framework search
        path directories, respectively, because linkers differ on how to specify
        them.

        If you specified:
          framework_switch = &quot;-framework &quot;
          weak_framework_switch = &quot;-weak_framework &quot;
          framework_dir_switch = &quot;-F&quot;
        and:
          framework_dirs = [ &quot;$root_out_dir&quot; ]
          frameworks = [ &quot;UIKit.framework&quot;, &quot;Foo.framework&quot; ]
          weak_frameworks = [ &quot;MediaPlayer.framework&quot; ]
        would be:
          &quot;-F. -framework UIKit -framework Foo -weak_framework MediaPlayer&quot;

    swiftmodule_switch [string, optional, link tools only]
        Valid for: Linker tools except &quot;alink&quot;

        The string will be prependend to the path to the .swiftmodule files
        that are embedded in the linker output.

        If you specified:
          swiftmodule_swift = &quot;-Wl,-add_ast_path,&quot;
        then the &quot;{{swiftmodules}}&quot; expansion for
          [ &quot;obj/foo/Foo.swiftmodule&quot; ]
        would be
          &quot;-Wl,-add_ast_path,obj/foo/Foo.swiftmodule&quot;

    outputs  [list of strings with substitutions]
        Valid for: Linker and compiler tools (required)

        An array of names for the output files the tool produces. These are
        relative to the build output directory. There must always be at least
        one output file. There can be more than one output (a linker might
        produce a library and an import library, for example).

        This array just declares to GN what files the tool will produce. It is
        your responsibility to specify the tool command that actually produces
        these files.

        If you specify more than one output for shared library links, you
        should consider setting link_output, depend_output, and
        runtime_outputs.

        Example for a compiler tool that produces .obj files:
          outputs = [
            &quot;{{source_out_dir}}/{{source_name_part}}.obj&quot;
          ]

        Example for a linker tool that produces a .dll and a .lib. The use of
        {{target_output_name}}, {{output_extension}} and {{output_dir}} allows
        the target to override these values.
          outputs = [
            &quot;{{output_dir}}/{{target_output_name}}{{output_extension}}&quot;,
            &quot;{{output_dir}}/{{target_output_name}}.lib&quot;,
          ]

    partial_outputs  [list of strings with substitutions]
        Valid for: &quot;swift&quot; only

        An array of names for the partial outputs the tool produces. These
        are relative to the build output directory. The expansion will be
        evaluated for each file listed in the &quot;sources&quot; of the target.

        This is used to deal with whole module optimization, allowing to
        list one object file per source file when whole module optimization
        is disabled.

    pool [label, optional]
        Valid for: all tools (optional)

        Label of the pool to use for the tool. Pools are used to limit the
        number of tasks that can execute concurrently during the build.

        See also &quot;gn help pool&quot;.

    link_output  [string with substitutions]
    depend_output  [string with substitutions]
        Valid for: &quot;solink&quot; only (optional)

        These two files specify which of the outputs from the solink tool
        should be used for linking and dependency tracking. These should match
        entries in the &quot;outputs&quot;. If unspecified, the first item in the
        &quot;outputs&quot; array will be used for all. See &quot;Separate linking and
        dependencies for shared libraries&quot; below for more.

        On Windows, where the tools produce a .dll shared library and a .lib
        import library, you will want the first two to be the import library
        and the third one to be the .dll file. On Linux, if you&#39;re not doing
        the separate linking/dependency optimization, all of these should be
        the .so output.

    output_prefix  [string]
        Valid for: Linker tools (optional)

        Prefix to use for the output name. Defaults to empty. This prefix will
        be prepended to the name of the target (or the output_name if one is
        manually specified for it) if the prefix is not already there. The
        result will show up in the {{output_name}} substitution pattern.

        Individual targets can opt-out of the output prefix by setting:
          output_prefix_override = true
        (see &quot;gn help output_prefix_override&quot;).

        This is typically used to prepend &quot;lib&quot; to libraries on
        Posix systems:
          output_prefix = &quot;lib&quot;

    precompiled_header_type  [string]
        Valid for: &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;cxx&quot;, &quot;objc&quot;, &quot;objcxx&quot;

        Type of precompiled headers. If undefined or the empty string,
        precompiled headers will not be used for this tool. Otherwise use &quot;gcc&quot;
        or &quot;msvc&quot;.

        For precompiled headers to be used for a given target, the target (or a
        config applied to it) must also specify a &quot;precompiled_header&quot; and, for
        &quot;msvc&quot;-style headers, a &quot;precompiled_source&quot; value. If the type is
        &quot;gcc&quot;, then both &quot;precompiled_header&quot; and &quot;precompiled_source&quot; must
        resolve to the same file, despite the different formats required for
        each.&quot;

        See &quot;gn help precompiled_header&quot; for more.

    restat  [boolean]
        Valid for: all tools (optional, defaults to false)

        Requests that Ninja check the file timestamp after this tool has run to
        determine if anything changed. Set this if your tool has the ability to
        skip writing output if the output file has not changed.

        Normally, Ninja will assume that when a tool runs the output be new and
        downstream dependents must be rebuild. When this is set to trye, Ninja
        can skip rebuilding downstream dependents for input changes that don&#39;t
        actually affect the output.

        Example:
          restat = true

    rspfile  [string with substitutions]
        Valid for: all tools except &quot;action&quot; (optional)

        Name of the response file. If empty, no response file will be
        used. See &quot;rspfile_content&quot;.

    rspfile_content  [string with substitutions]
        Valid for: all tools except &quot;action&quot; (required when &quot;rspfile&quot; is used)

        The contents to be written to the response file. This may include all
        or part of the command to send to the tool which allows you to get
        around OS command-line length limits.

        This example adds the inputs and libraries to a response file, but
        passes the linker flags directly on the command line:
          tool(&quot;link&quot;) {
            command = &quot;link -o {{output}} {{ldflags}} @{{output}}.rsp&quot;
            rspfile = &quot;{{output}}.rsp&quot;
            rspfile_content = &quot;{{inputs}} {{solibs}} {{libs}} {{rlibs}}&quot;
          }

    runtime_outputs  [string list with substitutions]
        Valid for: linker tools

        If specified, this list is the subset of the outputs that should be
        added to runtime deps (see &quot;gn help runtime_deps&quot;). By default (if
        runtime_outputs is empty or unspecified), it will be the link_output.
</code></pre><h4 id="expansions-for-tool-variables"><strong>Expansions for tool variables</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  All paths are relative to the root build directory, which is the current
  directory for running all tools. These expansions are available to all tools:

    {{label}}
        The label of the current target. This is typically used in the
        &quot;description&quot; field for link tools. The toolchain will be omitted from
        the label for targets in the default toolchain, and will be included
        for targets in other toolchains.

    {{label_name}}
        The short name of the label of the target. This is the part after the
        colon. For &quot;//foo/bar:baz&quot; this will be &quot;baz&quot;. Unlike
        {{target_output_name}}, this is not affected by the &quot;output_prefix&quot; in
        the tool or the &quot;output_name&quot; set on the target.

    {{label_no_toolchain}}
        The label of the current target, never including the toolchain
        (otherwise, this is identical to {{label}}). This is used as the module
        name when using .modulemap files.

    {{output}}
        The relative path and name of the output(s) of the current build step.
        If there is more than one output, this will expand to a list of all of
        them. Example: &quot;out/base/my_file.o&quot;

    {{target_gen_dir}}
    {{target_out_dir}}
        The directory of the generated file and output directories,
        respectively, for the current target. There is no trailing slash. See
        also {{output_dir}} for linker tools. Example: &quot;out/base/test&quot;

    {{target_output_name}}
        The short name of the current target with no path information, or the
        value of the &quot;output_name&quot; variable if one is specified in the target.
        This will include the &quot;output_prefix&quot; if any. See also {{label_name}}.

        Example: &quot;libfoo&quot; for the target named &quot;foo&quot; and an output prefix for
        the linker tool of &quot;lib&quot;.

  Compiler tools have the notion of a single input and a single output, along
  with a set of compiler-specific flags. The following expansions are
  available:

    {{asmflags}}
    {{cflags}}
    {{cflags_c}}
    {{cflags_cc}}
    {{cflags_objc}}
    {{cflags_objcc}}
    {{defines}}
    {{include_dirs}}
        Strings correspond that to the processed flags/defines/include
        directories specified for the target.
        Example: &quot;--enable-foo --enable-bar&quot;

        Defines will be prefixed by &quot;-D&quot; and include directories will be
        prefixed by &quot;-I&quot; (these work with Posix tools as well as Microsoft
        ones).

    {{module_deps}}
    {{module_deps_no_self}}
        Strings that correspond to the flags necessary to depend upon the Clang
        modules referenced by the current target. The &quot;_no_self&quot; version doesn&#39;t
        include the module for the current target, and can be used to compile
        the pcm itself.

    {{source}}
        The relative path and name of the current input file.
        Example: &quot;../../base/my_file.cc&quot;

    {{source_file_part}}
        The file part of the source including the extension (with no directory
        information).
        Example: &quot;foo.cc&quot;

    {{source_name_part}}
        The filename part of the source file with no directory or extension.
        Example: &quot;foo&quot;

    {{source_gen_dir}}
    {{source_out_dir}}
        The directory in the generated file and output directories,
        respectively, for the current input file. If the source file is in the
        same directory as the target is declared in, they will will be the same
        as the &quot;target&quot; versions above. Example: &quot;gen/base/test&quot;

  Linker tools have multiple inputs and (potentially) multiple outputs. The
  static library tool (&quot;alink&quot;) is not considered a linker tool. The following
  expansions are available:

    {{inputs}}
    {{inputs_newline}}
        Expands to the inputs to the link step. This will be a list of object
        files and static libraries.
        Example: &quot;obj/foo.o obj/bar.o obj/somelibrary.a&quot;

        The &quot;_newline&quot; version will separate the input files with newlines
        instead of spaces. This is useful in response files: some linkers can
        take a &quot;-filelist&quot; flag which expects newline separated files, and some
        Microsoft tools have a fixed-sized buffer for parsing each line of a
        response file.

    {{ldflags}}
        Expands to the processed set of ldflags and library search paths
        specified for the target.
        Example: &quot;-m64 -fPIC -pthread -L/usr/local/mylib&quot;

    {{libs}}
        Expands to the list of system libraries to link to. Each will be
        prefixed by the &quot;lib_switch&quot;.

        Example: &quot;-lfoo -lbar&quot;

    {{output_dir}}
        The value of the &quot;output_dir&quot; variable in the target, or the the value
        of the &quot;default_output_dir&quot; value in the tool if the target does not
        override the output directory. This will be relative to the
        root_build_dir and will not end in a slash. Will be &quot;.&quot; for output to
        the root_build_dir.

        This is subtly different than {{target_out_dir}} which is defined by GN
        based on the target&#39;s path and not overridable. {{output_dir}} is for
        the final output, {{target_out_dir}} is generally for object files and
        other outputs.

        Usually {{output_dir}} would be defined in terms of either
        {{target_out_dir}} or {{root_out_dir}}

    {{output_extension}}
        The value of the &quot;output_extension&quot; variable in the target, or the
        value of the &quot;default_output_extension&quot; value in the tool if the target
        does not specify an output extension.
        Example: &quot;.so&quot;

    {{solibs}}
        Extra libraries from shared library dependencies not specified in the
        {{inputs}}. This is the list of link_output files from shared libraries
        (if the solink tool specifies a &quot;link_output&quot; variable separate from
        the &quot;depend_output&quot;).

        These should generally be treated the same as libs by your tool.

        Example: &quot;libfoo.so libbar.so&quot;

    {{rlibs}}
        Any Rust .rlibs which need to be linked into a final C++ target.
        These should be treated as {{inputs}} except that sometimes
        they might have different linker directives applied.

        Example: &quot;obj/foo/libfoo.rlib&quot;

    {{frameworks}}
        Shared libraries packaged as framework bundle. This is principally
        used on Apple&#39;s platforms (macOS and iOS). All name must be ending
        with &quot;.framework&quot; suffix; the suffix will be stripped when expanding
        {{frameworks}} and each item will be preceded by &quot;-framework&quot; or
        &quot;-weak_framework&quot;.

    {{swiftmodules}}
        Swift .swiftmodule files that needs to be embedded into the binary.
        This is necessary to correctly link with object generated by the
        Swift compiler (the .swiftmodule file cannot be embedded in object
        files directly). Those will be prefixed with &quot;swiftmodule_switch&quot;
        value.

  The static library (&quot;alink&quot;) tool allows {{arflags}} plus the common tool
  substitutions.

  The copy tool allows the common compiler/linker substitutions, plus
  {{source}} which is the source of the copy. The stamp tool allows only the
  common tool substitutions.

  The copy_bundle_data and compile_xcassets tools only allows the common tool
  substitutions. Both tools are required to create iOS/macOS bundles and need
  only be defined on those platforms.

  The copy_bundle_data tool will be called with one source and needs to copy
  (optionally optimizing the data representation) to its output. It may be
  called with a directory as input and it needs to be recursively copied.

  The compile_xcassets tool will be called with one or more source (each an
  asset catalog) that needs to be compiled to a single output. The following
  substitutions are available:

    {{inputs}}
        Expands to the list of .xcassets to use as input to compile the asset
        catalog.

    {{bundle_product_type}}
        Expands to the product_type of the bundle that will contain the
        compiled asset catalog. Usually corresponds to the product_type
        property of the corresponding create_bundle target.

    {{bundle_partial_info_plist}}
        Expands to the path to the partial Info.plist generated by the
        assets catalog compiler. Usually based on the target_name of
        the create_bundle target.

    {{xcasset_compiler_flags}}
        Expands to the list of flags specified in corresponding
        create_bundle target.

  The Swift tool has multiple input and outputs. It must have exactly one
  output of .swiftmodule type, but can have one or more object file outputs,
  in addition to other type of ouputs. The following expansions are available:

    {{module_name}}
        Expands to the string representing the module name of target under
        compilation (see &quot;module_name&quot; variable).

    {{module_dirs}}
        Expands to the list of -I&lt;path&gt; for the target Swift module search
        path computed from target dependencies.

    {{swiftflags}}
        Expands to the list of strings representing Swift compiler flags.

  Rust tools have the notion of a single input and a single output, along
  with a set of compiler-specific flags. The following expansions are
  available:

    {{crate_name}}

</code></pre><h4 id="separate-linking-and-dependencies-for-shared-libraries"><strong>Separate linking and dependencies for shared libraries</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Shared libraries are special in that not all changes to them require that
  dependent targets be re-linked. If the shared library is changed but no
  imports or exports are different, dependent code needn&#39;t be relinked, which
  can speed up the build.

  If your link step can output a list of exports from a shared library and
  writes the file only if the new one is different, the timestamp of this file
  can be used for triggering re-links, while the actual shared library would be
  used for linking.

  You will need to specify
    restat = true
  in the linker tool to make this work, so Ninja will detect if the timestamp
  of the dependency file has changed after linking (otherwise it will always
  assume that running a command updates the output):

    tool(&quot;solink&quot;) {
      command = &quot;...&quot;

<pre><code>  A toolchain is a set of commands and build flags used to compile the source
  code. The toolchain() function defines these commands.
</code></pre><h4 id="toolchain-overview"><strong>Toolchain overview</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  You can have more than one toolchain in use at once in a build and a target
  can exist simultaneously in multiple toolchains. A build file is executed
  once for each toolchain it is referenced in so the GN code can vary all
  parameters of each target (or which targets exist) on a per-toolchain basis.

  When you have a simple build with only one toolchain, the build config file
  is loaded only once at the beginning of the build. It must call
  set_default_toolchain() (see &quot;gn help set_default_toolchain&quot;) to tell GN the
  label of the toolchain definition to use. The &quot;toolchain_args&quot; section of the
  toolchain definition is ignored.

  When a target has a dependency on a target using different toolchain (see &quot;gn
  help labels&quot; for how to specify this), GN will start a build using that
  secondary toolchain to resolve the target. GN will load the build config file
  with the build arguments overridden as specified in the toolchain_args.
  Because the default toolchain is already known, calls to
  set_default_toolchain() are ignored.

  To load a file in an alternate toolchain, GN does the following:

    1. Loads the file with the toolchain definition in it (as determined by the
       toolchain label).
    2. Re-runs the master build configuration file, applying the arguments
       specified by the toolchain_args section of the toolchain definition.
    3. Loads the destination build file in the context of the configuration file
       in the previous step.

  The toolchain configuration is two-way. In the default toolchain (i.e. the
  main build target) the configuration flows from the build config file to the
  toolchain. The build config file looks at the state of the build (OS type,
  CPU architecture, etc.) and decides which toolchain to use (via
  set_default_toolchain()). In secondary toolchains, the configuration flows
  from the toolchain to the build config file: the &quot;toolchain_args&quot; in the
  toolchain definition specifies the arguments to re-invoke the build.
</code></pre><h4 id="functions-and-variables"><strong>Functions and variables</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  tool()
    The tool() function call specifies the commands to run for a given step. See
    &quot;gn help tool&quot;.

  toolchain_args [scope]
    Overrides for build arguments to pass to the toolchain when invoking it.
    This is a variable of type &quot;scope&quot; where the variable names correspond to
    variables in declare_args() blocks.

    When you specify a target using an alternate toolchain, the master build
    configuration file is re-interpreted in the context of that toolchain.
    toolchain_args allows you to control the arguments passed into this
    alternate invocation of the build.

    Any default system arguments or arguments passed in via &quot;gn args&quot; will also
    be passed to the alternate invocation unless explicitly overridden by
    toolchain_args.

    The toolchain_args will be ignored when the toolchain being defined is the
    default. In this case, it&#39;s expected you want the default argument values.

    See also &quot;gn help buildargs&quot; for an overview of these arguments.

  propagates_configs [boolean, default=false]
    Determines whether public_configs and all_dependent_configs in this
    toolchain propagate to targets in other toolchains.

    When false (the default), this toolchain will not propagate any configs to
    targets in other toolchains that depend on it targets inside this
    toolchain. This matches the most common usage of toolchains where they
    represent different architectures or compilers and the settings that apply
    to one won&#39;t necessarily apply to others.

    When true, configs (public and all-dependent) will cross the boundary out
    of this toolchain as if the toolchain boundary wasn&#39;t there. This only
    affects one direction of dependencies: a toolchain can&#39;t control whether
    it accepts such configs, only whether it pushes them. The build is
    responsible for ensuring that any external targets depending on targets in
    this toolchain are compatible with the compiler flags, etc. that may be
    propagated.

  deps [string list]
    Dependencies of this toolchain. These dependencies will be resolved before
    any target in the toolchain is compiled. To avoid circular dependencies
    these must be targets defined in another toolchain.

    This is expressed as a list of targets, and generally these targets will
    always specify a toolchain:
      deps = [ &quot;//foo/bar:baz(//build/toolchain:bootstrap)&quot; ]

    This concept is somewhat inefficient to express in Ninja (it requires a lot
    of duplicate of rules) so should only be used when absolutely necessary.

<pre><code>  A list of target labels. Must be a subset of the target&#39;s &quot;deps&quot;. These
  targets will be permitted to include headers from the current target despite
  the dependency going in the opposite direction.

  When you use this, both targets must be included in a final binary for it to
  link. To keep linker errors from happening, it is good practice to have all
  external dependencies depend only on one of the two targets, and to set the
  visibility on the other to enforce this. Thus the targets will always be
  linked together in any output.
</code></pre><h4 id="details"><strong>Details</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Normally, for a file in target A to include a file from target B, A must list
  B as a dependency. This invariant is enforced by the &quot;gn check&quot; command (and
  the --check flag to &quot;gn gen&quot; -- see &quot;gn help check&quot;).

  Sometimes, two targets might be the same unit for linking purposes (two
  source sets or static libraries that would always be linked together in a
  final executable or shared library) and they each include headers from the
  other: you want A to be able to include B&#39;s headers, and B to include A&#39;s
  headers. This is not an ideal situation but is sometimes unavoidable.

  This list, if specified, lists which of the dependencies of the current
  target can include header files from the current target. That is, if A
  depends on B, B can only include headers from A if it is in A&#39;s
  allow_circular_includes_from list. Normally includes must follow the
  direction of dependencies, this flag allows them to go in the opposite
  direction.
</code></pre><h4 id="danger"><strong>Danger</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  In the above example, A&#39;s headers are likely to include headers from A&#39;s
  dependencies. Those dependencies may have public_configs that apply flags,
  defines, and include paths that make those headers work properly.

  With allow_circular_includes_from, B can include A&#39;s headers, and
  transitively from A&#39;s dependencies, without having the dependencies that
  would bring in the public_configs those headers need. The result may be
  errors or inconsistent builds.

  So when you use allow_circular_includes_from, make sure that any compiler
  settings, flags, and include directories are the same between both targets
  (consider putting such things in a shared config they can both reference).
  Make sure the dependencies are also the same (you might consider a group to
  collect such dependencies they both depend on).

    # Sources here can include headers from a despite lack of deps.

<pre><code>  A list of flags passed to the archive/lib command that creates static

  arflags are NOT pushed to dependents, so applying arflags to source sets or
  any other target type will be a no-op. As with ldflags, you could put the
  arflags in a config and set that as a public or &quot;all dependent&quot; config, but
  that will likely not be what you want. If you have a chain of static
  libraries dependent on each other, this can cause the flags to propagate up
  to other static libraries. Due to the nature of how arflags are typically
  used, you will normally want to apply them directly on static_library targets
  themselves.

<pre><code>  A list of label patterns.

  This list is a list of patterns that must not match any of the transitive
  dependencies of the target. These include all public, private, and data
  dependencies, and cross shared library boundaries. This allows you to express
  that undesirable code isn&#39;t accidentally added to downstream dependencies in
  a way that might otherwise be difficult to notice.

  Checking does not cross executable boundaries. If a target depends on an
  executable, it&#39;s assumed that the executable is a tool that is producing part
  of the build rather than something that is linked and distributed. This
  allows assert_no_deps to express what is distributed in the final target
  rather than depend on the internal build steps (which may include
  non-distributable code).

  See &quot;gn help label_pattern&quot; for the format of the entries in the list. These
  patterns allow blacklisting individual targets or whole directory
  hierarchies.

  Sometimes it is desirable to enforce that many targets have no dependencies
  on a target or set of targets. One efficient way to express this is to create
  a group with the assert_no_deps rule on it, and make that group depend on all
  targets you want to apply that assertion to.

<pre><code>  A static library normally doesn&#39;t include code from dependencies, but instead
  forwards the static libraries and source sets in its deps up the dependency
  chain until a linkable target (an executable or shared library) is reached.
  The final linkable target only links each static library once, even if it
  appears more than once in its dependency graph.

  In some cases the static library might be the final desired output. For
  example, you may be producing a static library for distribution to third
  parties. In this case, the static library should include code for all
  dependencies in one complete package. However, complete static libraries
  themselves are never linked into other complete static libraries. All
  complete static libraries are for distribution and linking them in would
  cause code duplication in this case. If the static library is not for
  distribution, it should not be complete.

  GN treats non-complete static libraries as source sets when they are linked
  into complete static libraries. This is done because some tools like AR do
  not handle dependent static libraries properly. This makes it easier to write
  &quot;alink&quot; rules.

  In rare cases it makes sense to list a header in more than one target if it
  could be considered conceptually a member of both. libraries.

<pre><code>  A list of config labels.
</code></pre><h4 id="configs-on-a-target"><strong>Configs on a target</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  When used on a target, the include_dirs, defines, etc. in each config are
  appended in the order they appear to the compile command for each file in the
  target. They will appear after the include_dirs, defines, etc. that the
  target sets directly.

  Since configs apply after the values set on a target, directly setting a
  compiler flag will prepend it to the command line. If you want to append a
  flag instead, you can put that flag in a one-off config and append that
  config to the target&#39;s configs list.

  The build configuration script will generally set up the default configs
  applying to a given target type (see &quot;set_defaults&quot;). When a target is being
  defined, it can add to or remove from this list.
</code></pre><h4 id="configs-on-a-config"><strong>Configs on a config</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  It is possible to create composite configs by specifying configs on a config.
  One might do this to forward values, or to factor out blocks of settings from
  very large configs into more manageable named chunks.

  In this case, the composite config is expanded to be the concatenation of its
  own values, and in order, the values from its sub-configs *before* anything
  else happens. This has some ramifications:

   - A target has no visibility into a config&#39;s sub-configs. Target code only
     sees the name of the composite config. It can&#39;t remove sub-configs or opt
     in to only parts of it. The composite config may not even be defined
     before the target is.

   - You can get duplication of values if a config is listed twice, say, on a
     target and in a sub-config that also applies. In other cases, the configs
     applying to a target are de-duped. It&#39;s expected that if a config is
     listed as a sub-config that it is only used in that context. (Note that
     it&#39;s possible to fix this and de-dupe, but it&#39;s not normally relevant and
     complicates the implementation.)

<pre><code>  Lists files or directories required to run the given target. These are

  as being relative to the current build file. Since these are runtime
  dependencies, they do not affect which targets are built or when. To declare
  input files to a script, use &quot;inputs&quot;.

  Appearing in the &quot;data&quot; section does not imply any special handling such as
  copying them to the output directory. This is just used for declaring runtime
  dependencies. Runtime dependencies can be queried using the &quot;runtime_deps&quot;
  category of &quot;gn desc&quot; or written during build generation via
  &quot;--runtime-deps-list-file&quot;.

  GN doesn&#39;t require data files to exist at build-time. So actions that produce
  files that are in turn runtime dependencies can list those generated files
  both in the &quot;outputs&quot; list as well as the &quot;data&quot; list.

  By convention, directories are listed with a trailing slash:
    data = [ &quot;test/data/&quot; ]
  However, no verification is done on these so GN doesn&#39;t enforce this. The
  paths are just rebased and passed along when requested.

  Propagation of all_dependent_configs and public_configs happens independently
  of target type. all_dependent_configs are always propagated across all types

<pre><code>  A list of label patterns (see &quot;gn help label_pattern&quot;) that allow dependent
  targets to include private headers. Applies to all binary targets.

  Normally if a target lists headers in the &quot;public&quot; list (see &quot;gn help
  public&quot;), other headers are implicitly marked as private. Private headers
  can not be included by other targets, even with a public dependency path.
  The &quot;gn check&quot; function performs this validation.

  A friend declaration allows one or more targets to include private headers.
  This is useful for things like unit tests that are closely associated with a
  target and require internal knowledge without opening up all headers to be
  included by all dependents.

  A friend target does not allow that target to include headers when no
  dependency exists. A public dependency path must still exist between two
  targets to include any headers from a destination target. The friend
  annotation merely allows the use of headers that would otherwise be
  prohibited because they are private.

  The friend annotation is matched only against the target containing the file
  with the include directive. Friend annotations are not propagated across
  public or private dependencies. Friend annotations do not affect visibility.

<pre><code>  Inputs are compile-time dependencies of the current target. This means that
  all inputs must be available before compiling any of the sources or executing
  any actions.

  Inputs are typically only used for action and action_foreach targets.
</code></pre><h4 id="inputs-for-actions"><strong>Inputs for actions</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  For action and action_foreach targets, inputs should be the inputs to script
  that don&#39;t vary. These should be all .py files that the script uses via
  imports (the main script itself will be an implicit dependency of the action
  so need not be listed).

  For action targets, inputs and sources are treated the same, but from a style
  perspective, it&#39;s recommended to follow the same rule as action_foreach and
  put helper files in the inputs, and the data used by the script (if any) in
  sources.

  Note that another way to declare input dependencies from an action is to have
  the action write a depfile (see &quot;gn help depfile&quot;). This allows the script to
  dynamically write input dependencies, that might not be known until actually
  executing the script. This is more efficient than doing processing while
  running GN to determine the inputs, and is easier to keep in-sync than
  hardcoding the list.
</code></pre><h4 id="script-input-gotchas"><strong>Script input gotchas</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  It may be tempting to write a script that enumerates all files in a directory
  as inputs. Don&#39;t do this! Even if you specify all the files in the inputs or
  sources in the GN target (or worse, enumerate the files in an exec_script
  call when running GN, which will be slow), the dependencies will be broken.

  The problem happens if a file is ever removed because the inputs are not
  listed on the command line to the script. Because the script hasn&#39;t changed
  and all inputs are up to date, the script will not re-run and you will get a
  stale build. Instead, either list all inputs on the command line to the
  script, or if there are many, create a separate list file that the script
  reads. As long as this file is listed in the inputs, the build will detect
  when it has changed in any way and the action will re-run.
</code></pre><h4 id="inputs-for-binary-targets"><strong>Inputs for binary targets</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Any input dependencies will be resolved before compiling any sources or
  linking the target. Normally, all actions that a target depends on will be run
  before any files in a target are compiled. So if you depend on generated
  headers, you do not typically need to list them in the inputs section.

  Inputs for binary targets will be treated as implicit dependencies, meaning
  that changes in any of the inputs will force all sources in the target to be
  recompiled. If an input only applies to a subset of source files, you may
  want to split those into a separate target to avoid unnecessary recompiles.

  output in a subdirectory of root_out_dir can result in collisions between
  different toolchains, so you will need to take steps to ensure that your
  target is only present in one toolchain.

  Normally the toolchain specifies the output directory for libraries and

<pre><code>  Normally the output name of a target will be based on the target name, so the

  &quot;bar_unittests.exe&quot; (using Windows as an example).

  Sometimes you will want an alternate name to avoid collisions or if the
  internal name isn&#39;t appropriate for public distribution.

  The output name should have no extension or prefixes, these will be added
  using the default system rules. For example, on Linux an output name of &quot;foo&quot;
  will produce a shared library &quot;libfoo.so&quot;. There is no way to override the
  output prefix of a linker tool on a per- target basis. If you need more
  flexibility, create a copy target to produce the file you want.

  This variable is valid for all binary output target types.

  copy
    Copy targets should have exactly one entry in the outputs list. If there is

<pre><code>  Precompiled headers will be used when a target specifies this value, or a
  config applying to this target specifies this value. In addition, the tool
  corresponding to the source files must also specify precompiled headers (see
  &quot;gn help tool&quot;). The tool will also specify what type of precompiled headers
  to use, by setting precompiled_header_type to either &quot;gcc&quot; or &quot;msvc&quot;.

  The precompiled header/source variables can be specified on a target or a
  config, but must be the same for all configs applying to a given target since
  a target can only have one precompiled header.

  If you use both C and C++ sources, the precompiled header and source file
  will be compiled once per language. You will want to make sure to wrap C++
  includes in __cplusplus #ifdefs so the file will compile in C mode.
</code></pre><h4 id="gcc-precompiled-headers"><strong>GCC precompiled headers</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  When using GCC-style precompiled headers, &quot;precompiled_source&quot; contains the
  path of a .h file that is precompiled and then included by all source files
  in targets that set &quot;precompiled_source&quot;.

  The value of &quot;precompiled_header&quot; is not used with GCC-style precompiled
  headers.
</code></pre><h4 id="msvc-precompiled-headers"><strong>MSVC precompiled headers</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  When using MSVC-style precompiled headers, the &quot;precompiled_header&quot; value is
  a string corresponding to the header. This is NOT a path to a file that GN
  recognises, but rather the exact string that appears in quotes after
  an #include line in source code. The compiler will match this string against
  includes or forced includes (/FI).

  MSVC also requires a source file to compile the header with. This must be
  specified by the &quot;precompiled_source&quot; value. In contrast to the header value,
  this IS a GN-style file name, and tells GN which source file to compile to
  make the .pch file used for subsequent compiles.

  For example, if the toolchain specifies MSVC headers:

    toolchain(&quot;vc_x64&quot;) {
      ...
      tool(&quot;cxx&quot;) {
        precompiled_header_type = &quot;msvc&quot;
        ...

  You might make a config like this:

    config(&quot;use_precompiled_headers&quot;) {
      precompiled_header = &quot;build/precompile.h&quot;
      precompiled_source = &quot;//build/precompile.cc&quot;

      # Either your source files should #include &quot;build/precompile.h&quot;
      # first, or you can do this to force-include the header.
      cflags = [ &quot;/FI$precompiled_header&quot; ]
    }

  And then define a target that uses the config:

    executable(&quot;doom_melon&quot;) {
      configs += [ &quot;:use_precompiled_headers&quot; ]

<pre><code>  A list of files that other targets can include. These permissions are checked
  via the &quot;check&quot; command (see &quot;gn help check&quot;).

  If no public files are declared, other targets (assuming they have visibility
  to depend on this target) can include any file in the sources list. If this
  variable is defined on a target, dependent targets may only include files on
  this whitelist unless that target is marked as a friend (see &quot;gn help
  friend&quot;).

  Header file permissions are also subject to visibility. A target must be
  visible to another target to include any files from it at all and the public
  headers indicate which subset of those files are permitted. See &quot;gn help
  visibility&quot; for more.

  Public files are inherited through the dependency tree. So if there is a
  dependency A -&gt; B -&gt; C, then A can include C&#39;s public headers. However, the
  same is NOT true of visibility, so unless A is in C&#39;s visibility list, the
  include will be rejected.

  GN only knows about files declared in the &quot;sources&quot; and &quot;public&quot; sections of
  targets. If a file is included that is not known to the build, it will be
  allowed.

  It is common for test targets to need to include private headers for their
  associated code. In this case, list the test target in the &quot;friend&quot; list of
  the target that owns the private header to allow the inclusion. See
  &quot;gn help friend&quot; for more.

  When a binary target has no explicit or implicit public headers (a &quot;public&quot;
  list is defined but is empty), GN assumes that the target can not propagate
  any compile-time dependencies up the dependency tree. In this case, the build
  can be parallelized more efficiently.
  Say there are dependencies:
    A (shared library) -&gt; B (shared library) -&gt; C (action).
  Normally C must complete before any source files in A can compile (because
  there might be generated includes). But when B explicitly declares no public
  headers, C can execute in parallel with A&#39;s compile steps. C must still be
  complete before any dependents link.

<pre><code>  Public configs are applied to all targets that depend directly on this one.
  These dependant targets can further push this target&#39;s public configs
  higher in the dependency tree by depending on it via public_deps (see &quot;gn
  help public_deps&quot;).

    static_library(&quot;toplevel&quot;) {
      # This target will get &quot;my_config&quot; applied to it. However, since this
      # target uses &quot;deps&quot; and not &quot;public_deps&quot;, targets that depend on this

  Public config propagation happens in a second phase once a target and all of
  its dependencies have been resolved. Therefore, a target will not see these
  force-added configs in their &quot;configs&quot; variable while the script is running,
  and they can not be removed. As a result, this capability should generally
  only be used to add defines and include directories rather than setting
  complicated flags that some targets may not want.

  Public configs may or may not be propagated across toolchain boundaries
  depending on the value of the propagates_configs flag (see &quot;gn help
  toolchain&quot;) on the toolchain of the target declaring the public_config.

  Generally if you are writing a target B and you include C&#39;s headers as part
  of B&#39;s public headers, or targets depending on B should consider B and C to
  be part of a unit, you should use public_deps instead of deps.

<pre><code>  A boolean that triggers a rebase of collected metadata strings based on their
  declared file. Defaults to false.

  Metadata generally declares files as strings relative to the local build file.
  However, this data is often used in other contexts, and so setting this flag
  will force the metadata collection to be rebased according to the local build
  file&#39;s location and thus allow the filename to be used anywhere.

  Setting this flag will raise an error if any target&#39;s specified metadata is
  not a string value.

<pre><code>  Sometimes the arguments passed to a script can be too long for the system&#39;s
  command-line capabilities. This is especially the case on Windows where the
  maximum command-line length is less than 8K. A response file allows you to
  pass an unlimited amount of data to a script in a temporary file for an
  action or action_foreach target.

  If the response_file_contents variable is defined and non-empty, the list
  will be treated as script args (including possibly substitution patterns)
  that will be written to a temporary file at build time. The name of the
  temporary file will be substituted for &quot;{{response_file_name}}&quot; in the script
  args.

  The response file contents will always be quoted and escaped according to
  Unix shell rules. To parse the response file, the Python script should use
  &quot;shlex.split(file_contents)&quot;.

<pre><code>  For binary targets (source sets, executables, and libraries), the known file
  types will be compiled with the associated tools. Unknown file types and
  headers will be skipped. However, you should still list all C/C+ header files
  so GN knows about the existence of those files for the purposes of include
  checking.

  As a special case, a file ending in &quot;.def&quot; will be treated as a Windows
  module definition file. It will be appended to the link line with a
  preceding &quot;/DEF:&quot; string. There must be at most one .def file in a target
  and they do not cross dependency boundaries (so specifying a .def file in a
  static library or source set will have no effect on the executable or shared
  library they&#39;re linked into).

  For Rust targets that do not specify a crate_root, then the crate_root will
  look for a lib.rs file (or main.rs for executable) or a single file in
  sources, if sources contains only one file.

<pre><code>  Build arguments are variables passed in from outside of the build that build
  files can query to determine how the build works.
</code></pre><h4 id="how-build-arguments-are-set"><strong>How build arguments are set</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  First, system default arguments are set based on the current system. The
  built-in arguments are:
   - host_cpu
   - host_os
   - current_cpu
   - current_os
   - target_cpu
   - target_os

  Next, project-specific overrides are applied. These are specified inside
  the default_args variable of //.gn. See &quot;gn help dotfile&quot; for more.

  If specified, arguments from the --args command line flag are used. If that
  flag is not specified, args from previous builds in the build directory will
  be used (this is in the file args.gn in the build directory).

  Last, for targets being compiled with a non-default toolchain, the toolchain
  overrides are applied. These are specified in the toolchain_args section of a
  toolchain definition. The use-case for this is that a toolchain may be
  building code for a different platform, and that it may want to always
  specify Posix, for example. See &quot;gn help toolchain&quot; for more.

  If you specify an override for a build argument that never appears in a
  &quot;declare_args&quot; call, a nonfatal error will be displayed.
</code></pre><h4 id="examples"><strong>Examples</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  gn args out/FooBar
      Create the directory out/FooBar and open an editor. You would type
      something like this into that file:
          enable_doom_melon=false
          os=&quot;android&quot;

  gn gen out/FooBar --args=&quot;enable_doom_melon=true os=\&quot;android\&quot;&quot;
      This will overwrite the build directory with the given arguments. (Note
      that the quotes inside the args command will usually need to be escaped
      for your shell to pass through strings values.)
</code></pre><h4 id="how-build-arguments-are-used"><strong>How build arguments are used</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  If you want to use an argument, you use declare_args() and specify default
  values. These default values will apply if none of the steps listed in the
  &quot;How build arguments are set&quot; section above apply to the given argument, but
  the defaults will not override any of these.

  Often, the root build config file will declare global arguments that will be
  passed to all buildfiles. Individual build files can also specify arguments
  that apply only to those files. It is also useful to specify build args in an
  &quot;import&quot;-ed file if you want such arguments to apply to multiple buildfiles.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-dotfile-a-gn-file"><a name="dotfile"></a><strong>.gn file</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  When gn starts, it will search the current directory and parent directories
  for a file called &quot;.gn&quot;. This indicates the source root. You can override
  this detection by using the --root command-line argument

  The .gn file in the source root will be executed. The syntax is the same as a
  buildfile, but with very limited build setup-specific meaning.

  If you specify --root, by default GN will look for the file .gn in that
  directory. If you want to specify a different file, you can additionally pass
  --dotfile:

    gn gen out/Debug --root=/home/build --dotfile=/home/my_gn_file.gn
</code></pre><h4 id="variables"><strong>Variables</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  arg_file_template [optional]
      Path to a file containing the text that should be used as the default
      args.gn content when you run `gn args`.

  buildconfig [required]
      Path to the build config file. This file will be used to set up the
      build file execution environment for each toolchain.

  check_targets [optional]
      A list of labels and label patterns that should be checked when running
      &quot;gn check&quot; or &quot;gn gen --check&quot;. If neither check_targets or
      no_check_targets (see below) is specified, all targets will be checked.
      It is an error to specify both check_targets and no_check_targets. If it
      is the empty list, no targets will be checked. To bypass this list,
      request an explicit check of targets, like &quot;//*&quot;.

      The format of this list is identical to that of &quot;visibility&quot; so see &quot;gn
      help visibility&quot; for examples.

  no_check_targets [optional]
      A list of labels and label patterns that should *not* be checked when
      running &quot;gn check&quot; or &quot;gn gen --check&quot;. All other targets will be checked.
      If neither check_targets (see above) or no_check_targets is specified, all
      targets will be checked. It is an error to specify both check_targets and
      no_check_targets.

      The format of this list is identical to that of &quot;visibility&quot; so see &quot;gn
      help visibility&quot; for examples.

  check_system_includes [optional]
      Boolean to control whether system style includes are checked by default
      when running &quot;gn check&quot; or &quot;gn gen --check&quot;.  System style includes are
      includes that use angle brackets &lt;&gt; instead of double quotes &quot;&quot;. If this
      setting is omitted or set to false, these includes will be ignored by
      default. They can be checked explicitly by running
      &quot;gn check --check-system&quot; or &quot;gn gen --check=system&quot;

  exec_script_whitelist [optional]
      A list of .gn/.gni files (not labels) that have permission to call the
      exec_script function. If this list is defined, calls to exec_script will
      be checked against this list and GN will fail if the current file isn&#39;t
      in the list.

      This is to allow the use of exec_script to be restricted since is easy to
      use inappropriately. Wildcards are not supported. Files in the
      secondary_source tree (if defined) should be referenced by ignoring the
      secondary tree and naming them as if they are in the main tree.

      If unspecified, the ability to call exec_script is unrestricted.

      Example:
        exec_script_whitelist = [
          &quot;//base/BUILD.gn&quot;,
          &quot;//build/my_config.gni&quot;,
        ]

  root [optional]
      Label of the root build target. The GN build will start by loading the
      build file containing this target name. This defaults to &quot;//:&quot; which will
      cause the file //BUILD.gn to be loaded. Note that build_file_extension
      applies to the default case as well.

      The command-line switch --root-target will override this value (see &quot;gn
      help --root-target&quot;).

  script_executable [optional]
      Path to specific Python executable or other interpreter to use in
      action targets and exec_script calls. By default GN searches the
      PATH for Python to execute these scripts.

      If set to the empty string, the path specified in action targets
      and exec_script calls will be executed directly.

  secondary_source [optional]
      Label of an alternate directory tree to find input files. When searching
      for a BUILD.gn file (or the build config file discussed above), the file
      will first be looked for in the source root. If it&#39;s not found, the
      secondary source root will be checked (which would contain a parallel
      directory hierarchy).

      This behavior is intended to be used when BUILD.gn files can&#39;t be checked
      in to certain source directories for whatever reason.

      The secondary source root must be inside the main source tree.

  default_args [optional]
      Scope containing the default overrides for declared arguments. These
      overrides take precedence over the default values specified in the
      declare_args() block, but can be overriden using --args or the
      args.gn file.

      This is intended to be used when subprojects declare arguments with
      default values that need to be changed for whatever reason.

  build_file_extension [optional]
      If set to a non-empty string, this is added to the name of all build files
      to load.
      GN will look for build files named &quot;BUILD.$build_file_extension.gn&quot;.
      This is intended to be used during migrations or other situations where
      there are two independent GN builds in the same directories.

  ninja_required_version [optional]
      When set specifies the minimum required version of Ninja. The default
      required version is 1.7.2. Specifying a higher version might enable the
      use of some of newer features that can make the build more efficient.

  2. Execute the build config file identified by .gn to set up the global

  3. Load the //BUILD.gn (in the source root directory).

  4. Recursively evaluate rules and load BUILD.gn in other directories as
     necessary to resolve dependencies. If a BUILD file isn&#39;t found in the

</code></pre><h4 id="executing-target-definitions-and-templates"><strong>Executing target definitions and templates</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Build files are loaded in parallel. This means it is impossible to
  interrogate a target from GN code for any information not derivable from its
  label (see &quot;gn help label&quot;). The exception is the get_target_outputs()
  function which requires the target being interrogated to have been defined
  previously in the same file.

  Targets are declared by their type and given a name:

    static_library(&quot;my_static_library&quot;) {
      ... target parameter definitions ...
    }

  There is also a generic &quot;target&quot; function for programmatically defined types
  (see &quot;gn help target&quot;). You can define new types using templates (see &quot;gn
  help template&quot;). A template defines some custom code that expands to one or
  more other targets.

  Before executing the code inside the target&#39;s { }, the target defaults are
  applied (see &quot;gn help set_defaults&quot;). It will inject implicit variable
  definitions that can be overridden by the target code as necessary. Typically
  this mechanism is used to inject a default set of configs that define the
  global compiler and linker flags.
</code></pre><h4 id="which-targets-are-built"><strong>Which targets are built</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  All targets encountered in the default toolchain (see &quot;gn help toolchain&quot;)
  will have build rules generated for them, even if no other targets reference
  them. Their dependencies must resolve and they will be added to the implicit
  &quot;all&quot; rule (see &quot;gn help ninja_rules&quot;).

  Targets in non-default toolchains will only be generated when they are
  required (directly or transitively) to build a target in the default

  A target&#39;s &quot;data_deps&quot; are guaranteed to be built whenever the target is
  built, but the ordering is not defined. The meaning of this is dependencies
  required at runtime. Currently data deps will be complete before the target
  is linked, but this is not semantically guaranteed and this is undesirable
  from a build performance perspective. Since we hope to change this in the
  future, do not rely on this behavior.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-grammar-a-language-and-grammar-for-gn-build-files"><a name="grammar"></a><strong>Language and grammar for GN build files</strong></h3>
<h4 id="tokens"><strong>Tokens</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  GN build files are read as sequences of tokens.  While splitting the file
  into tokens, the next token is the longest sequence of characters that form a
  valid token.
</code></pre><h4 id="white-space-and-comments"><strong>White space and comments</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  White space is comprised of spaces (U+0020), horizontal tabs (U+0009),
  carriage returns (U+000D), and newlines (U+000A).

  Comments start at the character &quot;#&quot; and stop at the next newline.

  White space and comments are ignored except that they may separate tokens
  that would otherwise combine into a single token.
</code></pre><h4 id="identifiers"><strong>Identifiers</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Identifiers name variables and functions.

      identifier = letter { letter | digit } .
      letter     = &quot;A&quot; ... &quot;Z&quot; | &quot;a&quot; ... &quot;z&quot; | &quot;_&quot; .
      digit      = &quot;0&quot; ... &quot;9&quot; .
</code></pre><h4 id="keywords"><strong>Keywords</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The following keywords are reserved and may not be used as identifiers:

          else    false   if      true
</code></pre><h4 id="integer-literals"><strong>Integer literals</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  An integer literal represents a decimal integer value.

      integer = [ &quot;-&quot; ] digit { digit } .

  Leading zeros and negative zero are disallowed.
</code></pre><h4 id="string-literals"><strong>String literals</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  A string literal represents a string value consisting of the quoted
  characters with possible escape sequences and variable expansions.

      string           = `&quot;` { char | escape | expansion } `&quot;` .
      escape           = `\` ( &quot;$&quot; | `&quot;` | char ) .
      BracketExpansion = &quot;{&quot; ( identifier | ArrayAccess | ScopeAccess ) &quot;}&quot; .
      Hex              = &quot;0x&quot; [0-9A-Fa-f][0-9A-Fa-f]
      expansion        = &quot;$&quot; ( identifier | BracketExpansion | Hex ) .
      char             = /* any character except &quot;$&quot;, `&quot;`, or newline */ .

  After a backslash, certain sequences represent special characters:

          \&quot;    U+0022    quotation mark
          \$    U+0024    dollar sign
          \\    U+005C    backslash

  All other backslashes represent themselves.

  To insert an arbitrary byte value, use $0xFF. For example, to insert a
  newline character: &quot;Line one$0x0ALine two&quot;.

  An expansion will evaluate the variable following the &#39;$&#39; and insert a
  stringified version of it into the result. For example, to concat two path
  components with a slash separating them:
    &quot;$var_one/$var_two&quot;
  Use the &quot;${var_one}&quot; format to be explicitly deliniate the variable for
  otherwise-ambiguous cases.
</code></pre><h4 id="punctuation"><strong>Punctuation</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The following character sequences represent punctuation:

          +       +=      ==      !=      (       )
          -       -=      &lt;       &lt;=      [       ]
          !       =       &gt;       &gt;=      {       }
                          &amp;&amp;      ||      .       ,
</code></pre><h4 id="grammar"><strong>Grammar</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The input tokens form a syntax tree following a context-free grammar:

      File = StatementList .

      Statement     = Assignment | Call | Condition .
      LValue        = identifier | ArrayAccess | ScopeAccess .
      Assignment    = LValue AssignOp Expr .
      Call          = identifier &quot;(&quot; [ ExprList ] &quot;)&quot; [ Block ] .
      Condition     = &quot;if&quot; &quot;(&quot; Expr &quot;)&quot; Block
                      [ &quot;else&quot; ( Condition | Block ) ] .
      Block         = &quot;{&quot; StatementList &quot;}&quot; .
      StatementList = { Statement } .

      ArrayAccess = identifier &quot;[&quot; Expr &quot;]&quot; .
      ScopeAccess = identifier &quot;.&quot; identifier .
      Expr        = UnaryExpr | Expr BinaryOp Expr .
      UnaryExpr   = PrimaryExpr | UnaryOp UnaryExpr .
      PrimaryExpr = identifier | integer | string | Call
                  | ArrayAccess | ScopeAccess | Block
                  | &quot;(&quot; Expr &quot;)&quot;
                  | &quot;[&quot; [ ExprList [ &quot;,&quot; ] ] &quot;]&quot; .
      ExprList    = Expr { &quot;,&quot; Expr } .

      AssignOp = &quot;=&quot; | &quot;+=&quot; | &quot;-=&quot; .
      UnaryOp  = &quot;!&quot; .
      BinaryOp = &quot;+&quot; | &quot;-&quot;                  // highest priority
               | &quot;&lt;&quot; | &quot;&lt;=&quot; | &quot;&gt;&quot; | &quot;&gt;=&quot;
               | &quot;==&quot; | &quot;!=&quot;
               | &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;
               | &quot;||&quot; .                     // lowest priority

  All binary operators are left-associative.
</code></pre><h4 id="types"><strong>Types</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The GN language is dynamically typed. The following types are used:

   - Boolean: Uses the keywords &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. There is no implicit
     conversion between booleans and integers.

   - Integers: All numbers in GN are signed 64-bit integers.

   - Strings: Strings are 8-bit with no enforced encoding. When a string is
     used to interact with other systems with particular encodings (like the
     Windows and Mac filesystems) it is assumed to be UTF-8. See &quot;String
     literals&quot; above for more.

   - Lists: Lists are arbitrary-length ordered lists of values. See &quot;Lists&quot;
     below for more.

   - Scopes: Scopes are like dictionaries that use variable names for keys. See
     &quot;Scopes&quot; below for more.
</code></pre><h4 id="lists"><strong>Lists</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Lists are created with [] and using commas to separate items:

       mylist = [ 0, 1, 2, &quot;some string&quot; ]

  A comma after the last item is optional. Lists are dereferenced using 0-based
  indexing:

       mylist[0] += 1
       var = mylist[2]

  Lists can be concatenated using the &#39;+&#39; and &#39;+=&#39; operators. Bare values can
  not be concatenated with lists, to add a single item, it must be put into a
  list of length one.

  Items can be removed from lists using the &#39;-&#39; and &#39;-=&#39; operators. This will
  remove all occurrences of every item in the right-hand list from the
  left-hand list. It is an error to remove an item not in the list. This is to
  prevent common typos and to detect dead code that is removing things that no
  longer apply.

  It is an error to use &#39;=&#39; to replace a nonempty list with another nonempty
  list. This is to prevent accidentally overwriting data when in most cases
  &#39;+=&#39; was intended. To overwrite a list on purpose, first assign it to the
  empty list:

    mylist = []
    mylist = otherlist
</code></pre><h4 id="scopes"><strong>Scopes</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  All execution happens in the context of a scope which holds the current state
  (like variables). With the exception of loops and conditions, &#39;{&#39; introduces
  a new scope that has a parent reference to the old scope.

  Variable reads recursively search all nested scopes until the variable is
  found or there are no more scopes. Variable writes always go into the current
  scope. This means that after the closing &#39;}&#39; (again excepting loops and
  conditions), all local variables will be restored to the previous values.
  This also means that &quot;foo = foo&quot; can do useful work by copying a variable
  into the current scope that was defined in a containing scope.

  Scopes can also be assigned to variables. Such scopes can be created by
  functions like exec_script, when invoking a template (the template code
  refers to the variables set by the invoking code by the implicitly-created
  &quot;invoker&quot; scope), or explicitly like:

    empty_scope = {}
    myvalues = {
      foo = 21
      bar = &quot;something&quot;
    }

  Inside such a scope definition can be any GN code including conditionals and
  function calls. After the close of the scope, it will contain all variables
  explicitly set by the code contained inside it. After this, the values can be
  read, modified, or added to:

    myvalues.foo += 2
    empty_scope.new_thing = [ 1, 2, 3 ]

  Scope equality is defined as single-level scopes identical within the current
  scope. That is, all values in the first scope must be present and identical
  within the second, and vice versa. Note that this means inherited scopes are
  always unequal by definition.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-io_conversion-a-input-and-output-conversion"><a name="io_conversion"></a><strong>Input and output conversion</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  Input and output conversions are arguments to file and process functions
  that specify how to convert data to or from external formats. The possible
  values for parameters specifying conversions are:

  &quot;&quot; (the default)
      input: Discard the result and return None.

      output: If value is a list, then &quot;list lines&quot;; otherwise &quot;value&quot;.

  &quot;list lines&quot;
      input:
        Return the file contents as a list, with a string for each line. The
        newlines will not be present in the result. The last line may or may
        not end in a newline.

        After splitting, each individual line will be trimmed of whitespace on
        both ends.

      output:
        Renders the value contents as a list, with a string for each line. The
        newlines will not be present in the result. The last line will end in
        with a newline.

  &quot;scope&quot;
      input:
        Execute the block as GN code and return a scope with the resulting
        values in it. If the input was:
          a = [ &quot;hello.cc&quot;, &quot;world.cc&quot; ]
          b = 26
        and you read the result into a variable named &quot;val&quot;, then you could
        access contents the &quot;.&quot; operator on &quot;val&quot;:
          sources = val.a
          some_count = val.b

      output:
        Renders the value contents as a GN code block, reversing the input
        result above.

  &quot;string&quot;
      input: Return the file contents into a single string.

      output:
        Render the value contents into a single string. The output is:
        a string renders with quotes, e.g. &quot;str&quot;
        an integer renders as a stringified integer, e.g. &quot;6&quot;
        a boolean renders as the associated string, e.g. &quot;true&quot;
        a list renders as a representation of its contents, e.g. &quot;[\&quot;str\&quot;, 6]&quot;
        a scope renders as a GN code block of its values. If the Value was:
            Value val;
            val.a = [ &quot;hello.cc&quot;, &quot;world.cc&quot; ];
            val.b = 26
          the resulting output would be:
            &quot;{
                a = [ \&quot;hello.cc\&quot;, \&quot;world.cc\&quot; ]
                b = 26
            }&quot;

  &quot;value&quot;
      input:
        Parse the input as if it was a literal rvalue in a buildfile. Examples of
        typical program output using this mode:
          [ &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; ]     (result will be a list)
        or
          &quot;foo bar&quot;            (result will be a string)
        or
          5                    (result will be an integer)

        Note that if the input is empty, the result will be a null value which
        will produce an error if assigned to a variable.

      output:
        Render the value contents as a literal rvalue. Strings render with
        escaped quotes.

  &quot;json&quot;
      input: Parse the input as a JSON and convert it to equivalent GN rvalue.

      output: Convert the Value to equivalent JSON value.

      The data type mapping is:
        a string in JSON maps to string in GN
        an integer in JSON maps to integer in GN
        a float in JSON is unsupported and will result in an error
        an object in JSON maps to scope in GN
        an array in JSON maps to list in GN
        a boolean in JSON maps to boolean in GN
        a null in JSON is unsupported and will result in an error

      Nota that the input dictionary keys have to be valid GN identifiers
      otherwise they will produce an error.

  &quot;trim ...&quot; (input only)
      Prefixing any of the other transformations with the word &quot;trim&quot; will
      result in whitespace being trimmed from the beginning and end of the
      result before processing.

      Examples: &quot;trim string&quot; or &quot;trim list lines&quot;

      Note that &quot;trim value&quot; is useless because the value parser skips
      whitespace anyway.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-file_pattern-a-file-patterns"><a name="file_pattern"></a><strong>File patterns</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  File patterns are VERY limited regular expressions. They must match the
  entire input string to be counted as a match. In regular expression parlance,
  there is an implicit &quot;^...$&quot; surrounding your input. If you want to match a
  substring, you need to use wildcards at the beginning and end.

  There are only two special tokens understood by the pattern matcher.
  Everything else is a literal.

   - &quot;*&quot; Matches zero or more of any character. It does not depend on the
     preceding character (in regular expression parlance it is equivalent to
     &quot;.*&quot;).

   - &quot;\b&quot; Matches a path boundary. This will match the beginning or end of a
     string, or a slash.
</code></pre><h4 id="pattern-examples"><strong>Pattern examples</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  &quot;*asdf*&quot;
      Matches a string containing &quot;asdf&quot; anywhere.

  &quot;asdf&quot;
      Matches only the exact string &quot;asdf&quot;.

  &quot;*.cc&quot;
      Matches strings ending in the literal &quot;.cc&quot;.

  &quot;\bwin/*&quot;
      Matches &quot;win/foo&quot; and &quot;foo/win/bar.cc&quot; but not &quot;iwin/foo&quot;.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-label_pattern-a-label-patterns"><a name="label_pattern"></a><strong>Label patterns</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  A label pattern is a way of expressing one or more labels in a portion of the
  source tree. They are not general regular expressions.

  They can take the following forms only:

   - Explicit (no wildcard):
       &quot;//foo/bar:baz&quot;
       &quot;:baz&quot;

   - Wildcard target names:
       &quot;//foo/bar:*&quot; (all targets in the //foo/bar/BUILD.gn file)
       &quot;:*&quot;  (all targets in the current build file)

   - Wildcard directory names (&quot;*&quot; is only supported at the end)
       &quot;*&quot;  (all targets)
       &quot;//foo/bar/*&quot;  (all targets in any subdir of //foo/bar)
       &quot;./*&quot;  (all targets in the current build file or sub dirs)

  Any of the above forms can additionally take an explicit toolchain
  in parenthesis at the end of the label pattern. In this case, the
  toolchain must be fully qualified (no wildcards are supported in the
  toolchain name).

    &quot;//foo:bar(//build/toolchain:mac)&quot;
        An explicit target in an explicit toolchain.

    &quot;:*(//build/toolchain/linux:32bit)&quot;
        All targets in the current build file using the 32-bit Linux toolchain.

    &quot;//foo/*(//build/toolchain:win)&quot;
        All targets in //foo and any subdirectory using the Windows
        toolchain.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-labels-a-about-labels"><a name="labels"></a><strong>About labels</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  Everything that can participate in the dependency graph (targets, configs,
  and toolchains) are identified by labels. A common label looks like:

    //base/test:test_support

  This consists of a source-root-absolute path, a colon, and a name. This means
  to look for the thing named &quot;test_support&quot; in &quot;base/test/BUILD.gn&quot;.

  You can also specify system absolute paths if necessary. Typically such
  paths would be specified via a build arg so the developer can specify where
  the component is on their system.

    /usr/local/foo:bar    (Posix)
    /C:/Program Files/MyLibs:bar   (Windows)
</code></pre><h4 id="toolchains"><strong>Toolchains</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  A canonical label includes the label of the toolchain being used. Normally,
  the toolchain label is implicitly inherited from the current execution
  context, but you can override this to specify cross-toolchain dependencies:

    //base/test:test_support(//build/toolchain/win:msvc)

  Here GN will look for the toolchain definition called &quot;msvc&quot; in the file
  &quot;//build/toolchain/win&quot; to know how to compile this target.
</code></pre><h4 id="relative-labels"><strong>Relative labels</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  If you want to refer to something in the same buildfile, you can omit
  the path name and just start with a colon. This format is recommended for
  all same-file references.

    :base

  Labels can be specified as being relative to the current directory.
  Stylistically, we prefer to use absolute paths for all non-file-local
  references unless a build file needs to be run in different contexts (like a
  project needs to be both standalone and pulled into other projects in
  difference places in the directory hierarchy).

    source/plugin:myplugin
    ../net:url_request
</code></pre><h4 id="implicit-names"><strong>Implicit names</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  If a name is unspecified, it will inherit the directory name. Stylistically,
  we prefer to omit the colon and name when possible:

    //net  -&gt;  //net:net
    //tools/gn  -&gt;  //tools/gn:gn
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-metadata_collection-a-metadata-collection"><a name="metadata_collection"></a><strong>Metadata Collection</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  Metadata is information attached to targets throughout the dependency tree. GN
  allows for the collection of this data into files written during the generation
  step, enabling users to expose and aggregate this data based on the dependency
  tree.
</code></pre><h4 id="generated_file-targets"><strong>generated_file targets</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Similar to the write_file() function, the generated_file target type
  creates a file in the specified location with the specified content. The
  primary difference between write_file() and this target type is that the
  write_file function does the file write at parse time, while the
  generated_file target type writes at target resolution time. See
  &quot;gn help generated_file&quot; for more detail.

  When written at target resolution time, generated_file enables GN to
  collect and write aggregated metadata from dependents.

  A generated_file target can declare either &#39;contents&#39; to write statically
  known contents to a file or &#39;data_keys&#39; to aggregate metadata and write the
  result to a file. It can also specify &#39;walk_keys&#39; (to restrict the metadata
  collection), &#39;output_conversion&#39;, and &#39;rebase&#39;.
</code></pre><h4 id="collection-and-aggregation"><strong>Collection and Aggregation</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Targets can declare a &#39;metadata&#39; variable containing a scope, and this
  metadata may be collected and written out to a file specified by
  generated_file aggregation targets. The &#39;metadata&#39; scope must contain
  only list values since the aggregation step collects a list of these values.

  During the target resolution, generated_file targets will walk their
  dependencies recursively, collecting metadata based on the specified
  &#39;data_keys&#39;. &#39;data_keys&#39; is specified as a list of strings, used by the walk
  to identify which variables in dependencies&#39; &#39;metadata&#39; scopes to collect.

  The walk begins with the listed dependencies of the &#39;generated_file&#39; target.
  The &#39;metadata&#39; scope for each dependency is inspected for matching elements
  of the &#39;generated_file&#39; target&#39;s &#39;data_keys&#39; list.  If a match is found, the
  data from the dependent&#39;s matching key list is appended to the aggregate walk
  list. Note that this means that if more than one walk key is specified, the
  data in all of them will be aggregated into one list. From there, the walk
  will then recurse into the dependencies of each target it encounters,
  collecting the specified metadata for each.

  For example:

    group(&quot;a&quot;) {
      metadata = {
        doom_melon = [ &quot;enable&quot; ]
        my_files = [ &quot;foo.cpp&quot; ]
        my_extra_files = [ &quot;bar.cpp&quot; ]
      }

      deps = [ &quot;:b&quot; ]
    }

    group(&quot;b&quot;) {
      metadata = {
        my_files = [ &quot;baz.cpp&quot; ]
      }
    }

    generated_file(&quot;metadata&quot;) {
      outputs = [ &quot;$root_build_dir/my_files.json&quot; ]
      data_keys = [ &quot;my_files&quot;, &quot;my_extra_files&quot; ]

      deps = [ &quot;:a&quot; ]
    }

  The above will produce the following file data:

    foo.cpp
    bar.cpp
    baz.cpp

  The dependency walk can be limited by using the &#39;walk_keys&#39;. This is a list of
  labels that should be included in the walk. All labels specified here should
  also be in one of the deps lists. These keys act as barriers, where the walk
  will only recurse into the targets listed. An empty list in all specified
  barriers will end that portion of the walk.

    group(&quot;a&quot;) {
      metadata = {
        my_files = [ &quot;foo.cpp&quot; ]
        my_files_barrier = [ &quot;:b&quot; ]
      }

      deps = [ &quot;:b&quot;, &quot;:c&quot; ]
    }

    group(&quot;b&quot;) {
      metadata = {
        my_files = [ &quot;bar.cpp&quot; ]
      }
    }

    group(&quot;c&quot;) {
      metadata = {
        my_files = [ &quot;doom_melon.cpp&quot; ]
      }
    }

    generated_file(&quot;metadata&quot;) {
      outputs = [ &quot;$root_build_dir/my_files.json&quot; ]
      data_keys = [ &quot;my_files&quot; ]
      walk_keys = [ &quot;my_files_barrier&quot; ]

      deps = [ &quot;:a&quot; ]
    }

  The above will produce the following file data (note that `doom_melon.cpp` is
  not included):

    foo.cpp
    bar.cpp

  A common example of this sort of barrier is in builds that have host tools
  built as part of the tree, but do not want the metadata from those host tools
  to be collected with the target-side code.
</code></pre><h4 id="common-uses"><strong>Common Uses</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Metadata can be used to collect information about the different targets in the
  build, and so a common use is to provide post-build tooling with a set of data
  necessary to do aggregation tasks. For example, if each test target specifies
  the output location of its binary to run in a metadata field, that can be
  collected into a single file listing the locations of all tests in the
  dependency tree. A local build tool (or continuous integration infrastructure)
  can then use that file to know which tests exist, and where, and run them
  accordingly.

  Another use is in image creation, where a post-build image tool needs to know
  various pieces of information about the components it should include in order
  to put together the correct image.

<h4 id="the-all-and-default-rules"><strong>The &quot;all&quot; and &quot;default&quot; rules</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  All generated targets (see &quot;gn help execution&quot;) will be added to an implicit
  build rule called &quot;all&quot; so &quot;ninja all&quot; will always compile everything. The
  default rule will be used by Ninja if no specific target is specified (just
  typing &quot;ninja&quot;). If there is a target named &quot;default&quot; in the root build file,
  it will be the default build rule, otherwise the implicit &quot;all&quot; rule will be
  used.
</code></pre><h4 id="phony-rules"><strong>Phony rules</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  GN generates Ninja &quot;phony&quot; rules for targets in the default toolchain.  The
  phony rules can collide with each other and with the names of generated files
  so are generated with the following priority:

    1. Actual files generated by the build always take precedence.

    2. Targets in the toplevel //BUILD.gn file.

    3. Targets in toplevel directories matching the names of the directories.
       So &quot;ninja foo&quot; can be used to compile &quot;//foo:foo&quot;. This only applies to
       the first level of directories since usually these are the most
       important (so this won&#39;t apply to &quot;//foo/bar:bar&quot;).

    4. The short names of executables if there is only one executable with that
       short name. Use &quot;ninja doom_melon&quot; to compile the
       &quot;//tools/fruit:doom_melon&quot; executable.

    5. The short names of all targets if there is only one target with that
       short name.

    6. Full label name with no leading slashes. So you can use
       &quot;ninja tools/fruit:doom_melon&quot; to build &quot;//tools/fruit:doom_melon&quot;.

    7. Labels with an implicit name part (when the short names match the
       directory). So you can use &quot;ninja foo/bar&quot; to compile &quot;//foo/bar:bar&quot;.

  These &quot;phony&quot; rules are provided only for running Ninja since this matches
  people&#39;s historical expectations for building. For consistency with the rest
  of the program, GN introspection commands accept explicit labels.

  To explicitly compile a target in a non-default toolchain, you must give
  Ninja the exact name of the output file relative to the build directory.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-nogncheck-a-nogncheck-skip-an-include-line-from-checking-"><a name="nogncheck"></a><strong>nogncheck</strong>: Skip an include line from checking.</h3>
<pre><code>  GN&#39;s header checker helps validate that the includes match the build
  dependency graph. Sometimes an include might be conditional or otherwise
  problematic, but you want to specifically allow it. In this case, it can be
  whitelisted.

  Include lines containing the substring &quot;nogncheck&quot; will be excluded from
  header checking. The most common case is a conditional include:

    #if defined(ENABLE_DOOM_MELON)
    #include &quot;tools/doom_melon/doom_melon.h&quot;  // nogncheck
    #endif

  If the build file has a conditional dependency on the corresponding target
  that matches the conditional include, everything will always link correctly:

    source_set(&quot;mytarget&quot;) {
      ...
      if (enable_doom_melon) {
        defines = [ &quot;ENABLE_DOOM_MELON&quot; ]
        deps += [ &quot;//tools/doom_melon&quot; ]
      }

  But GN&#39;s header checker does not understand preprocessor directives, won&#39;t
  know it matches the build dependencies, and will flag this include as
  incorrect when the condition is false.
</code></pre><h4 id="more-information"><strong>More information</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The topic &quot;gn help check&quot; has general information on how checking works and
  advice on fixing problems. Targets can also opt-out of checking, see
  &quot;gn help check_includes&quot;.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-runtime_deps-a-runtime-dependencies"><a name="runtime_deps"></a><strong>Runtime dependencies</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  Runtime dependencies of a target are exposed via the &quot;runtime_deps&quot; category
  of &quot;gn desc&quot; (see &quot;gn help desc&quot;) or they can be written at build generation
  time via write_runtime_deps(), or --runtime-deps-list-file (see &quot;gn help
  --runtime-deps-list-file&quot;).

  To a first approximation, the runtime dependencies of a target are the set of
  &quot;data&quot; files, data directories, and the shared libraries from all transitive
  dependencies. Executables, shared libraries, and loadable modules are
  considered runtime dependencies of themselves.
</code></pre><h4 id="executables"><strong>Executables</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Executable targets and those executable targets&#39; transitive dependencies are
  not considered unless that executable is listed in &quot;data_deps&quot;. Otherwise, GN
  assumes that the executable (and everything it requires) is a build-time
  dependency only.
</code></pre><h4 id="actions-and-copies"><strong>Actions and copies</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Action and copy targets that are listed as &quot;data_deps&quot; will have all of their
  outputs and data files considered as runtime dependencies. Action and copy
  targets that are &quot;deps&quot; or &quot;public_deps&quot; will have only their data files
  considered as runtime dependencies. These targets can list an output file in
  both the &quot;outputs&quot; and &quot;data&quot; lists to force an output file as a runtime
  dependency in all cases.

  The different rules for deps and data_deps are to express build-time (deps)
  vs. run-time (data_deps) outputs. If GN counted all build-time copy steps as
  data dependencies, there would be a lot of extra stuff, and if GN counted all
  run-time dependencies as regular deps, the build&#39;s parallelism would be
  unnecessarily constrained.

  This rule can sometimes lead to unintuitive results. For example, given the
  three targets:
    A  --[data_deps]--&gt;  B  --[deps]--&gt;  ACTION
  GN would say that A does not have runtime deps on the result of the ACTION,
  which is often correct. But the purpose of the B target might be to collect
  many actions into one logic unit, and the &quot;data&quot;-ness of A&#39;s dependency is
  lost. Solutions:

   - List the outputs of the action in its data section (if the results of
     that action are always runtime files).
   - Have B list the action in data_deps (if the outputs of the actions are
     always runtime files).
   - Have B list the action in both deps and data deps (if the outputs might be
     used in both contexts and you don&#39;t care about unnecessary entries in the
     list of files required at runtime).
   - Split B into run-time and build-time versions with the appropriate &quot;deps&quot;
     for each.
</code></pre><h4 id="static-libraries-and-source-sets"><strong>Static libraries and source sets</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  The results of static_library or source_set targets are not considered
  runtime dependencies since these are assumed to be intermediate targets only.
  If you need to list a static library as a runtime dependency, you can
  manually compute the .a/.lib file name for the current platform and list it
  in the &quot;data&quot; list of a target (possibly on the static library target
  itself).
</code></pre><h4 id="multiple-outputs"><strong>Multiple outputs</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Linker tools can specify which of their outputs should be considered when
  computing the runtime deps by setting runtime_outputs. If this is unset on
  the tool, the default will be the first output only.
</code></pre><h3 id="-a-name-source_expansion-a-how-source-expansion-works"><a name="source_expansion"></a><strong>How Source Expansion Works</strong></h3>
<pre><code>  Source expansion is used for the action_foreach and copy target types to map
  source file names to output file names or arguments.

  To perform source expansion in the outputs, GN maps every entry in the
  sources to every entry in the outputs list, producing the cross product of
  all combinations, expanding placeholders (see below).

  Source expansion in the args works similarly, but performing the placeholder
  substitution produces a different set of arguments for each invocation of the
  script.

  If no placeholders are found, the outputs or args list will be treated as a
  static list of literal file names that do not depend on the sources.

  See &quot;gn help copy&quot; and &quot;gn help action_foreach&quot; for more on how this is
  applied.
</code></pre><h4 id="placeholders"><strong>Placeholders</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  This section discusses only placeholders for actions. There are other
  placeholders used in the definition of tools. See &quot;gn help tool&quot; for those.

  {{source}}
      The name of the source file including directory (*). This will generally
      be used for specifying inputs to a script in the &quot;args&quot; variable.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;../../foo/bar/baz.txt&quot;

  {{source_file_part}}
      The file part of the source including the extension.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;baz.txt&quot;

  {{source_name_part}}
      The filename part of the source file with no directory or extension. This
      will generally be used for specifying a transformation from a source file
      to a destination file with the same name but different extension.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;baz&quot;

  {{source_dir}}
      The directory (*) containing the source file with no trailing slash.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;../../foo/bar&quot;

  {{source_root_relative_dir}}
      The path to the source file&#39;s directory relative to the source root, with
      no leading &quot;//&quot; or trailing slashes. If the path is system-absolute,
      (beginning in a single slash) this will just return the path with no
      trailing slash. This value will always be the same, regardless of whether
      it appears in the &quot;outputs&quot; or &quot;args&quot; section.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;foo/bar&quot;

  {{source_gen_dir}}
      The generated file directory (*) corresponding to the source file&#39;s path.
      This will be different than the target&#39;s generated file directory if the
      source file is in a different directory than the BUILD.gn file.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;gen/foo/bar&quot;

  {{source_out_dir}}
      The object file directory (*) corresponding to the source file&#39;s path,
      relative to the build directory. this us be different than the target&#39;s
      out directory if the source file is in a different directory than the
      build.gn file.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;obj/foo/bar&quot;

  {{source_target_relative}}
      The path to the source file relative to the target&#39;s directory. This will
      generally be used for replicating the source directory layout in the
      output directory. This can only be used in actions and bundle_data
      targets. It is an error to use in process_file_template where there is no
      &quot;target&quot;.
        &quot;//foo/bar/baz.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;baz.txt&quot;
</code></pre><h4 id="-note-on-directories"><strong>(*) Note on directories</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Paths containing directories (except the source_root_relative_dir) will be
  different depending on what context the expansion is evaluated in. Generally
  it should &quot;just work&quot; but it means you can&#39;t concatenate strings containing
  these values with reasonable results.

  Details: source expansions can be used in the &quot;outputs&quot; variable, the &quot;args&quot;
  variable, and in calls to &quot;process_file_template&quot;. The &quot;args&quot; are passed to a
  script which is run from the build directory, so these directories will
  relative to the build directory for the script to find. In the other cases,
  the directories will be source- absolute (begin with a &quot;//&quot;) because the
  results of those expansions will be handled by GN internally.
</code></pre><h4 id="examples"><strong>Examples</strong></h4>
<pre><code>  Non-varying outputs:
    action(&quot;hardcoded_outputs&quot;) {
      sources = [ &quot;input1.idl&quot;, &quot;input2.idl&quot; ]
      outputs = [ &quot;$target_out_dir/output1.dat&quot;,
                  &quot;$target_out_dir/output2.dat&quot; ]
    }
  The outputs in this case will be the two literal files given.

  Varying outputs:
    action_foreach(&quot;varying_outputs&quot;) {
      sources = [ &quot;input1.idl&quot;, &quot;input2.idl&quot; ]
      outputs = [ &quot;{{source_gen_dir}}/{{source_name_part}}.h&quot;,
                  &quot;{{source_gen_dir}}/{{source_name_part}}.cc&quot; ]
    }
  Performing source expansion will result in the following output names:
    //out/Debug/obj/mydirectory/input1.h
    //out/Debug/obj/mydirectory/input1.cc
    //out/Debug/obj/mydirectory/input2.h
    //out/Debug/obj/mydirectory/input2.cc
